<h4 class="part3">
<a name="sysv">System V init (sysvinit)</a></h4>
<p>
is based on a <a href="#runlevel">runlevel</a> concept. The SysV
<code>init</code> examines <samp>/etc/inittab</samp> for
a line that sets a default <samp>runlevel</samp>:</p>

<div class="file">
<pre>id:3:initdefault:</pre>
</div>
<p>
If there is no such line, user is prompted to enter runlevel
value manually. The initialization process is synchronous,
i.e., the next task wouldn't start until the current one is finished.
The <code>init</code> daemon runs scripts in <samp>/etc/init.d</samp> dir.
The order of execution is defined by the symlinks in <samp>/etc/rc.d</samp>
dir. The names of these symlinks are interpreted as follows: first letter
<samp>S</samp> means that the script must be invoked during startup, first
letter <samp>K</samp> - during shutdown, digits set the order of invocation.
By modern standards <b>sysvinit</b> is slow and resource-consuming.
It is also inconvenient for the desktop systems, that require fast and
reliable interaction with USB devices, removable storage, etc.</p>



<h4 class="part3">
<a name="upstart">Upstart</a></h4>
<p>
is an <a href="init_defs.html">event-based</a> system, that starts and
stops <a href="init_defs.html">services</a> and
<a href="init_defs.html">tasks</a> asynchronously, and supervises them
while OS is running. The time and the order [of the specific service start]
depend on a set of conditions (like the presence of processes that a service
depends upon).
The main <b>Upstart</b> programs are the <code>init</code> (daemon)
and the <code><a href="cmds_i.html#initctl">initctl</a></code> (it starts
and stops init <a href="init_defs.html">jobs</a>, sends signals, and queries
the status of jobs. The <b>Upstart</b> <code>init</code> daemon tries to
perform tasks in parallel to finish the boot procedure as fast as possible.
<b>Upstart</b> service config files (equivalent of <b>Sys&nbsp;V</b> init
scripts) are in <samp>/etc/init</samp> dir. Here is an example of a simple
service config file for a permanently running daemon (server application
listening on some tcp port); this config file provides start/stop and auto
restart in case of an abnormal exit:</p>
<div class="file">
<pre>
# htpasd - this server app provides ... ...;

description "third-party daemon"

start on (net-device-up and local-filesystems)
stop on runlevel [!2345]

expect fork
respawn

exec htpasd</pre>
</div>
<p>
You can find details using <code>&nbsp;man 5 init&nbsp;</code> and multiple
examples in <samp>/etc/init</samp> (if your system is <b>Upstart</b>-based,
of course).</p>
<p>
Classical <samp>/etc/inittab</samp> is not neccessary any more, though
it can be present. To set the default runlevel, edit</p>

<p class="fmt"><samp>/etc/init/rc-sysinit.conf</samp></p>
<p>
<b>Upstart</b> consists of 5 packages:</p>

<p class="fmtc"><samp>upstart</samp></p>
<p class="desc"><code>init</code> daemon, <code>initctl</code>;</p>

<p class="fmtc"><samp>upstart-logd</samp></p>
<p class="desc"><code>logd</code> daemon and job definition file for
<code>logd</code>;</p>

<p class="fmtc"><samp>upstart-compat-sysv</samp></p>
<p class="desc">SysV job definition files and utilities: <code>reboot</code>,
<code>runlevel</code>, <code>shutdown</code>, <code>telinit</code>;</p>

<p class="fmtc"><samp>startup-tasks</samp></p>
<p class="desc">job definition files for system startup tasks;</p>

<p class="fmtc"><samp>system-services</samp></p>
<p class="desc">job definition files for tty services;</p>
<p>
See usage examples in
<code><a href="cmds_i.html#initctl">initctl</a></code>.</p>
<p>
Though <b>Upstart</b> is backward-compatible with <b>sysvinit</b> and runs
the old-style scripts unmodified, you should not rely on the old tools like
<code><a href="cmds_c.html#chkconfig">chkconfig</a></code>,
<code>rc-sysv-conf</code>, <code>ntsysv</code> - they control old-style
services only. The new-style services are being started and
stopped if/when the pre-defined conditions are met. To prevent the start
of a new-style service during system start, change the extension of the
corresponding config file, e.g.:</p>

<p class="cmd">cd /etc/init</p>
<p class="cmd">mv dovecot.conf dovecot.disabled</p>
<p class="cmd">stop dovecot</p>
<p>
You also have such options as moving the service <samp>.conf</samp> file
to some dir, or totally deleting it (unwise), or removing the
appropriate software pkg from the system (should be carefully considered).
The last cmd (<code>stop</code>) is required if the service is currently
running.</p>



<h4 class="part3">
<a name="runlevel">Runlevel</a></h4>
<p>
defines the certain system's state, characterized by the set of the running
services (daemons). It is a System V paradigm. The last Ubuntu releases
emulate runlevels for backward compatibility with the old-style scripts
and for compatibility with the third-party applications intended for other
distributions.</p>
<p>
There could be up to 8 runlevels, but only 3 are <b>mandatory</b>:</p>

<table class="grid">
<tr>
<th class="grid">RL</th>
<th class="grid">Name</th>
<th class="grid">Description</th></tr>
<tr>
<td class="gridcen"><samp>0</samp></td>
<td class="grid">Halt</td>
<td class="grid">Modern x86 computers usually power off when run level
<samp>0</samp> is reached; older x86, and some different architectures
display a message and stay on;</td></tr>
<tr>
<td class="gridcen"><samp>1</samp></td>
<td class="grid">Single user mode</td>
<td class="grid">In run level <samp>1</samp>
no daemons (services) are started;
<a href="boot.html#single_user">GRUB / Recovery mode (single user mode)</a>

<td class="gridcen"><samp>6</samp></td>
<td class="grid">Reboot</td>
<td class="grid">This is like runlevel <samp>0</samp> except a reboot is
issued at the end of the sequence instead of a power off;</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
The other runlevels are treated differently by different systems.
It's supposed, that for each supported runlevel, <samp>/etc/inittab</samp>
has a description of what should be done when the system switches from one
runlevel to another.</p>

<table class="grid">
<tr>
<th class="grid">RL</th>
<th class="grid">Description</th></tr>
<tr>
<td class="gridcen"><samp>2</samp></td>
<td class="grid">Full scale multi-user mode without GUI; default
runlevel for Red Hat/Fedora server, Ubuntu, Debian (see note below);</td></tr>
<tr>
<td class="gridcen"><samp>3</samp></td>
<td class="grid">Same as previous plus NFS (?);
default runlevel for Arch Linux, Gentoo, Slackware;</td></tr>
<tr>
<td class="gridcen"><samp>4</samp></td>
<td class="grid">Usually undefined;</td></tr>
<tr>
<td class="gridcen"><samp>5</samp></td>
<td class="grid">Full scale multi-user mode with GUI,
i.e., the most appropriate mode for the desktop systems;
default runlevel for Mandriva Linux, SUSE Linux, Red Hat/Fedora desktop;</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
In Ubuntu/Debian runlevels <samp>2</samp>, <samp>3</samp>,
<samp>5</samp> are all the same (multi-user, GUI). To check the current
runlevel:</p>
