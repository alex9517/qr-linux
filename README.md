# Linux Concise Reference

This is a [ relatively ] compact Linux reference (**command line** stuff mostly). It's Ubuntu-centric, but the majority of
Unix/Linux programs/utilities are not bound to a specific distro, i.e., you don't have to be Ubuntu person to use `chmod` or `tar`.

How is this better than the standard Linux man pages? Well, Linux man pages follow some *de facto* (?) standard often producing
excessive quantity of words and not so many examples. Sometimes a couple of good examples is all you need to understand (or recall)
how to use some command you need right now (no time or desire to parse a lengthy description). I don't say that man pages are bad,
I just think it's time to reconsider, to restructure, to prioritize.

My idea is simple: some good examples first, descriptions and explanations down below. Read it if you need it, or ignore.


## Technical details

It's HTML/CSS/JS, manually created, i.e. source files are readable and editable (if you know HTML/CSS).

Probably I should have excluded JavaScript and jQuery. And obviously `main.css` requires optimization. But this is an old project
and radical changes would be time consuming. So, maybe some day ...

There are two versions: one for the big screens (PC, laptop), one for the smartphones.

- [PC version](https://alex9517.github.io/qr-linux/index_2.html) is two columns (iframes), fixed width (1294px), tested mostly with
Mozilla Firefox.
- [Mobile version](https://alex9517.github.io/qr-linux) tested with Android smartphone, not tested with any tablets. I think the PC
version may be acceptable for the 10" (or bigger) tablets.


## Disclaimer

It was created for practical purposes, not for sale or prestige.

It's not perfect, some parts are outdated, some parts are just bad. I update it when I use it and notice that something is
wrong, inconsistent, incomprehensible, old. In other words, I try to improve it when I have time, i.e., not often.

So, you can use it as is, or fork, download, modify, and adjust to your requirements.

I think these man pages are more convenient than distro native/internal:
