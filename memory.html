<a name="mem64">64-bit (x86-64) memory</a></h4>
<p>
Though theoretically virtual addresses are <samp>64</samp> bits wide in
<samp>64</samp>-bit mode, current
<span class="sserif"><b><a href="howto.html#x86-64">x86-64</a></b></span>
implementations do not allow the entire virtual address space of
<samp>2<sup>64</sup></samp> bytes (<samp>16</samp> EB) to be used. In fact,
<samp>64</samp>-bit Linux allows only up to <samp>128</samp> TB of virtual
address space for individual processes, and can address approximately
<samp>64</samp> TB of physical memory, subject to processor and system
limitations.</p>

<img class="float_right" src="images/AMD64_canonical_48-bit.png" />
<p>
While working on <span class="sserif"><b>x86-64</b></span> spec, AMD decided
that operating systems and applications won't need <samp>2<sup>64</sup></samp>
address space in the foreseeable future, and there is no reason to increase the
complexity and cost of hardware. Thus, only <samp>48</samp> bits of virtual
address are used in address translation. And since AMD spec also requires that
bits <samp>48-63</samp> (i.e. most significant <samp>16</samp> bits) of any
virtual address must be copies of bit <samp>47</samp> (like sign extension),
the address space consists of "lower half"
(<samp>0000000'00000000 - 00007FFF'FFFFFFFF</samp>) and "higher half"
(<samp>FFFF8000'00000000 - FFFFFFFF'FFFFFFFF</samp>) with a big gap in the
middle. Addresses complying with this rule are referred to as <b>canonical
form</b> addresses. Even with this limitations we still have <samp>256</samp>
TB of usable virtual address space, which is <samp>65,536</samp> times larger
than <samp>4</samp> GB of <samp>32</samp>-bit machines.</p>
<p>
Linux OS takes the higher half of the address space for itself (<b>kernel
space</b>) and leaves the lower half for app code, user mode stacks, heaps,
etc (<b>user space</b>).</p>
<p>
This architecture has two primary modes of operation:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Long mode</b> (primary mode; used by <samp>64</samp>-bit OSs only)
is a combination of the processor's native <samp>64</samp>-bit mode and
<samp>32</samp>-bit/<samp>16</samp>-bit compatibility mode. <samp>64</samp>-bit
programs run under <samp>64</samp>-bit mode, <samp>32</samp>-bit and
<samp>16</samp>-bit protected mode apps (that do not need to use either real
mode or virtual 8086 mode) run under compatibility mode. Real-mode programs
and programs that use virtual 8086 mode at any time cannot be run in long mode
unless those modes are emulated in software. However, such programs may be
started from an OS running in long mode on processors supporting VT-x or AMD-V
by creating a virtual processor running in the desired mode.</li>

<li><b>Legacy mode</b> is used by <samp>16</samp>-bit ("protected mode"
or "real mode") and <samp>32</samp>-bit operating systems. In this mode, the
processor acts like a <samp>32</samp>-bit x86 proc, and only
<samp>16</samp>-bit and <samp>32</samp>-bit code can be executed. Legacy mode
allows for a maximum of <samp>32</samp> bit virtual addressing which limits the
virtual address space to <samp>4</samp> GB. <samp>64-bit</samp> programs cannot
be run from legacy mode.</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="part2">
<a name="mem32">32-bit (x86) memory</a></h4>
<p>
<samp>32</samp>-bit architectures can reference <samp>4</samp> GB of physical
memory (<samp>2<sup>32</sup></samp>). Processors that have an MMU (Memory
Management Unit) support the concept of virtual memory: page tables are set up
by the kernel which map "virtual addresses" to "physical addresses"; this means
that each process can access <samp>4</samp> GB of mem, thinking it's the only
proc running on the machine.</p>
<p>
The virtual address to physical address mappings are done by the kernel.
When a new proc is forked, the kernel creates a new set of page tables for
the proc. The addresses referenced within a process in user-space are virtual
addresses. They do not necessarily map directly to the same physical address.
The virtual address is passed to the MMU which converts it to the proper
physical address based on the tables set up by the kernel. Thus, 2
processes can refer to mem address <samp>0x08329</samp>, but they would
refer to 2 different locations in memory.</p>
<p>
The Linux kernel splits the <samp>4</samp> GB virtual address space of
a process in two parts: <samp>3</samp> GB and <samp>1</samp> GB. The lower
<samp>3</samp> GB of the process virtual address space is accessible as the
user-space virtual addresses and the upper <samp>1</samp> GB space is reserved
for the kernel virtual addresses. This is true for all processes.</p>
<p>
The kernel virtual area (<samp>3-4</samp> GB address space) maps to the first
<samp>1</samp> GB of physical RAM. The <samp>3</samp> GB addressable RAM
available to each proc is mapped to the available physical RAM.</p>
<p>
The basic problem: the kernel can address <samp>1</samp> GB of virtual
addresses, which can translate to a maximum of <samp>1</samp> GB of physical
memory. This is because the kernel directly maps all available kernel virtual
space addresses to the available physical memory.</p>


<h5>Solutions</h5>
<p>
There are following solutions:</p>
<ol>
<li><samp>2G/2G</samp> or <samp>1G/3G</samp> split</li>
<li><samp>HIGHMEM</samp> solution for using up to <samp>4</samp> GB of memory</li>
<li><samp>HIGHMEM</samp> solution for using up to <samp>64</samp> GB of memory</li>
</ol>
<p>
<samp>PAE</samp> (Physical Address Extension) allows processors to access
physical mem up to <samp>64</samp> GB (<samp>36</samp> bits of address bus).
However, since the virtual addr space is just <samp>32</samp> bits wide, each
proc can't grow beyond <samp>4</samp> GB. The mechanism used to access mem from
<samp>4</samp> GB to <samp>64</samp> GB is essentially the same as that of
accessing the <samp>1-4 GB</samp> RAM via the <samp>HIGHMEM</samp> solution.</p>

<table class="grid">
<tr>
<td class="grid_2"><samp>ZONE_DMA</samp></td>
<td class="grid_2_cen"><samp>0 MB - 16 MB</samp></td></tr>
<tr>
<td class="grid_2"><samp>ZONE_NORMAL</samp></td>
<td class="grid_2_cen"><samp>16 MB - 896 MB</samp></td></tr>
<tr>
<td class="grid_2"><samp>ZONE_HIGHMEM</samp></td>
<td class="grid_2_cen"><samp>1 GB - 64 GB</samp></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
<samp>ZONE_DMA</samp> is used by some devices for data transfer and is
mapped in the lower phys mem range (up to <samp>16</samp> MB). Memory in the
<samp>ZONE_NORMAL</samp> region is mapped by the kernel in the upper region
of the linear addr space. Most operations can only take place in
<samp>ZONE_NORMAL</samp>; so this is the most performance critical
zone. <samp>ZONE_NORMAL</samp> goes from <samp>16</samp> MB to
<samp>896</samp> MB.</p>
<p>
<samp>128</samp> MB (on <samp>x86</samp>) is reserved for storing
several kernel data structures that store info about the mem map and page
tables. This means that the kernel virtual address in this <samp>128</samp>
MB is not mapped to phys mem. Thus, even if you have <samp>1</samp> GB of
physical RAM, only <samp>896</samp> MB will be actually available for
<samp>ZONE_NORMAL</samp>.</p>
<p>
To address memory from <samp>1</samp> GB onwards (<samp>ZONE_HIGHMEM</samp>),
the kernel has to map pages from high mem into <samp>ZONE_NORMAL</samp>.</p>

<h4 class="part2">
<a name="mem_page">Memory page</a></h4>
<p>
(or just <b>page</b>, or <b>virtual page</b>) is a fixed-length contiguous
block of virtual memory, described by a single entry in the page table. It's
the smallest unit of data for memory management in a virtual memory OS.
A <b>page frame</b> is the smallest fixed-length contiguous block of physical
memory into which mem pages are mapped by OS.</p>
<p>
In the past all mem pages had a uniform size, usually <samp>4</samp> KB
(<samp>4096</samp> bytes). Modern processors allow to use pages of several
sizes, though <samp>4</samp> KB stays most popular for general purpose systems.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="sserif"><b>x86</b></span> arch (<samp>32</samp>-bit) supports
<samp>4</samp> KB, <samp>2</samp> MB (in PAE mode), <samp>4</samp> MB (in PSE
mode).</li>
<li><span class="sserif"><b>x86-64</b></span> arch (long mode) supports
<samp>4</samp> KB, <samp>2</samp> MB, <samp>1</samp> GB (only CPUs with
<samp>PDPE1GB</samp> flag).</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>PSE</b> - Page Size Extension, a feature of old x86 processors
(Pentium Pro, etc).</p>
<p>
<b>PAE</b> - Physical Address Extension (sometimes "Page Address Extension")
is a mem management feature for <span class="sserif"><b>x86</b></span> arch.
It defines a page table hierarchy of three levels (instead of two), with table
entries of <samp>64</samp> bits each instead of <samp>32</samp>, allowing these
CPUs to directly access a physical address space larger than <samp>4</samp> GB.</p>
<p>
The page table struct used by <span class="sserif"><b>x86-64</b></span> CPUs
[in long mode] extends the page table hierarchy to four levels, and uses
additional physical address bits at all levels of the page table, extending the
physical address space. It also uses the topmost bit of the <samp>64</samp>-bit
page table entry as a "no-execute bit" (<b>NX</b>), indicating that the code
from the associated page cannot be executed. NX feature is also available in
protected mode when these CPUs are running a <samp>32</samp>-bit OS, provided
that PAE is enabled.</p>
<p>
To find your system's page size, try:</p>

<p class="cmd">getconf PAGESIZE</p>
<p>
Note that the use of larger pages usually requires elevated privileges,
cooperation from the app making the large allocation (usually setting a flag
to ask OS for huge pages), or manual admin config; paging (swapping) of large
pages out to disk may not work.</p>
