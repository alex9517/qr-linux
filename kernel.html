The Linux kernel is/has/supports:</p>
<ul>
<li>a <b>monolithic</b> kernel,</li>
<li>true <b>preemptive multitasking</b> (both in user mode and, since v2.6,
in kernel mode),</li>
<li><b>virtual memory</b>,</li>
<li><b>shared libraries</b>,</li>
<li><b>demand loading</b>,</li>
<li><b>shared copy-on-write executables</b> (via KSM, kernel same-page
merging),</li>
<li>memory management,</li>
<li>the Internet protocol suite,</li>
<li>multithreading;</li>
</ul>
<p>
Here is a <i>very simplified</i> diagram of the Linux architecture:</p>

<img class="centered" src="images/linux_arch_simple_1.jpg" />
<p>
Device drivers and kernel extensions run in kernel space (ring <samp>0</samp>
in many CPU architectures), with full access to the hardware, although some
exceptions run in user space, e.g., filesystems based on FUSE/CUSE, and parts
of UIO. The graphics system most people use with Linux does not run within the
kernel, in contrast to that found in Microsoft Windows. Unlike standard
old-style monolithic kernels, Linux device drivers are easily configured as
modules, and loaded or unloaded while the system is running. Also, unlike
standard monolithic kernels, device drivers can be pre-empted under certain
conditions; this feature was added to handle hardware interrupts correctly,
and to better support symmetric multiprocessing. By choice, the Linux kernel
has no binary kernel interface.</p>
<p>
The hardware is also incorporated into the file hierarchy. Device drivers
interface to user apps via an entry in the <samp>/dev</samp> or
<samp>/sys</samp>, process info is mapped to the filesystem through
the <samp>/proc</samp> dir.</p>
<p>
See <a href="images/Linux_kernel_map.png">Linux kernel map</a> for more
details.</p>
<p>
The following diagram shows how the Linux kernel was growing in size from
version to version.</p>

<h5>KSM</h5>
<p>
<b>kernel same-page merging</b> (aka <b>kernel shared memory</b> and
<b>memory merging</b>) is (since version 2.6.32) a kernel feature that
allows a hypervisor system to share identical mem pages amongst different
processes or virtualized guests. While not directly linked, Kernel-based
Virtual Machine (KVM) can use KSM to merge memory pages occupied by virtual
machines.</p>
<p>
KSM performs the memory sharing by scanning main memory and finding duplicate
pages. Each detected duplicate pair is then merged into a single page, and
mapped into both original locations. The page is also marked as COW
(copy-on-write); kernel auto makes a copy of such page if a process tries to
modify it.</p>


<h5>Kernel-to-userspace API</h5>
<p>
Source code portability ensures that a C program written by conforming
to a standard can be successfully compiled and run on any system that also
conforms to the same standard. The relevant standards, aiming to achieve
source code portability of programs, that the development of the Linux kernel,
the GNU C Library, and associated utilities tries to adhere to, are
<b>POSIX</b> and the <b>Single UNIX Specification</b>. However, as of
February 2014, no Linux distributions are branded as "UNIX" by The Open Group,
mainly because of the costs of the conformance testing.
The <b>Linux kernel API</b> of the Linux kernel, representing the kernel's
system call interface, is composed of the available system calls.</p>


<h5>Kernel-to-userspace ABI</h5>
<p>
Binary portability shall guarantee that any program once compiled for a given
hardware platform, can be run in its compiled form on any other hardware
platform that conforms to the standard. Binary portability is an essential
requirement for the commercial viability of independent software vendor (ISV)
applications built for the operating systems based on the Linux kernel.
Binary compatibility is much more demanding than source code portability;
as of February 2014, the only standard concerning itself with binary
compatibility is the <b>Linux Standard Base</b> (LSB).</p>


<h5>In-kernel API</h5>
<p>
There are a couple of kernel internal APIs utilized between the different
subsystems and subsystems of subsystems. Some of them have been kept stable
over several releases, other have not. There are no guarantees regarding the
in-kernel APIs. Maintainers and contributors are free to augment or change
them at any time.</p>
<p>
Examples of in-kernel APIs include software frameworks/APIs for the following
classes of device drivers:</p>
<ul>
<li><samp>Video4Linux</samp> - for video capture hardware;</li>
<li><samp>Advanced Linux Sound Architecture</samp> - for sound cards;</li>
<li><samp>New API</samp> - for network interface controllers;</li>
<li><samp>Direct Rendering Manager</samp> - for graphics accelerators;</li>
<li><samp>KMS driver</samp> - for display controllers;</li>
<li><samp>mac80211</samp> - for wireless network interface controllers;</li>
<li><samp>WEXT</samp> - for wireless network interface controllers (obsolete);</li>
</ul>


<h5>In-kernel ABI</h5>
<p>
Strong interests in defining and maintaining a stable in-kernel ABI over
several releases have been voiced repeatedly over time by parties, e.g.
hardware manufactures, writing proprietary kernel modules and distributing
binary-only software, e.g. device drivers.</p>
<p>
By explicit choice the <i>Linux kernel does not maintain a stable in-kernel
ABI</i>. The reasons are purely technical and not philosophical. Due to the
absence of an in-kernel ABI that has to be kept stable over releases, the
Linux kernel can keep a much higher rate of development.</p>

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel" target="_top">Wikipedia</a>)</p>


<h5>
<a name="slab">Slabs</a></h5>
<p>
(since Linux Kernel 2.4)</p>
<p>
In Linux kernel frequently used objects (buffer heads, inodes, etc) have
their own caches - slabs. <b>Slab</b> is a mem cache for identical objects
that are uniform in size and are allocated and released many times during
the life of the kernel.</p>
<p>
Technically, a slab is a set of one or more contiguous pages of memory set
aside by the <b>slab allocator</b> for an individual cache. This memory is
further divided into equal segments of the size of the object type that
this cache is managing.</p>
<p>
To see what exactly is kept in those slabs, try:</p>

<p class="cmdc">sudo cat /proc/slabinfo</p>
<p class="or">or</p>
<p class="cmd">sudo vmstat -m</p>
<p>
(the last cmd outputs less info, but easier to read)</p>
<p>
In the past these objects were created and released with
<samp>kmalloc()</samp> and <samp>kfree()</samp> kernel calls. However, it was
very inefficient solution, and since version 2.4 Linux kernel implements a
caching memory allocator (<b>slab allocator</b>) which manages individual
caches (slabs) of identical objects on behalf of kernel modules and drivers.</p>



<h2>
<a name="kernel_src">Kernel from source</a></h2>
<p class="center">(<b>Outdated</b>)</p>
<p>
Assumptions: 2.6.x kernel and 2.6.x.x patches; user is <samp>root</samp>.
Download kernel source and latest patch from the nearest mirror of
<a href="http://www.kernel.org" target="_top">www.kernel.org</a>. Optionally,
check the archive's digital signature:</p>

<p class="cmd">gpgv linux-2.6.28.bz2.sign linux-2.6.28.bz2</p>
<p>
You must have the corresponding public key: download it from
<a href="http://wwwkeys.pgp.net" target="_top">wwwkeys.pgp.net</a>, import (see
<code>gpg --import</code>) and copy <samp>pubring.gpg</samp> to
<samp>trustedkeys.gpg</samp>.
Copy  archive to <samp>/usr/src/kernels</samp> (default location), unpack:</p>

<p class="cmd">tar jxvf linux-2.6.28.tar.bz2</p>
<p>
Check ownership (must be <samp>root.root</samp>). Create a symlink:</p>

<p class="cmd">ln -s linux-2.6.28 linux</p>
<p>
If you have a fresh patch, copy it to <samp>/usr/src/kernels</samp>:</p>

<p class="cmdc">cd linux</p>
<p class="cmdc">gzip –cd ../patch-2.6.28.5.gz | patch –p1</p>
<p class="or">or</p>
<p class="cmd">bzip2 –dc ../patch-2.6.28.5.bz2 | patch –p1</p>
<p>
Note that patches with 4-part version numbers (<samp>2.6.x.x</samp>) are
cummulative, so you must have a basic kernel version (<samp>2.6.x</samp>)
and the latest patch. The following cmd is required after patching only:</p>

<p class="cmd">make mrproper</p>
<p>
(it cleans the kernel source dir and removes <samp>.config</samp>).
Now, go to <samp>/usr/src/kernels/linux</samp> and do the most complicated
part - kernel configuration. To save time, get some reliable config file
from the latest (nearest) kernel available (search in <samp>/boot</samp>;
or install the latest binary kernel for your distribution; alternatively,
you can use your own old config). Copy it to
<samp>/usr/src/kernels/linux</samp>, rename to <samp>.config</samp>,
check mode / ownership (<samp>644/root.root</samp>), and upgrade:</p>

<p class="cmd">make oldconfig</p>
<p>
Now, you can start kernel configuration:</p>
<p class="fmt"><code>make menuconfig&nbsp;</code> (ncurses-based / text mode and X11)</p>
<p class="fmt"><code>make xconfig&nbsp;</code> (QT-based / X11)</p>
<p class="fmt"><code>make gconfig&nbsp;</code> (GTK-based / X11)</p>
<p class="fmt"><code>make config&nbsp;</code> (old-style, inconvenient)</p>
<p>
When config is done, build new kernel:</p>

<p class="cmd">make all</p>
<p>
It takes time and system resources. On success continue with:</p>

<p class="cmd">make modules_install</p>
<p>
And, finally:</p>

<p class="cmd">make install</p>
<p>
The last cmd installs a new kernel, makes changes to
<samp>grub.conf</samp>, etc.
If kernel is good, save <samp>.config</samp> for future use.
