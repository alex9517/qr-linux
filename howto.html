<h5>How to get miscellaneous system info?</h5>
<p>
<a name="release"></a>
Which <b>Linux version</b> do I have?</p>

<p class="cmd">lsb_release -a</p>
<p>
(see below how to find <a href="#kernel_version">kernel version</a>)</p>
<p>
<a name="mem_page"></a>
How large is the <a href="memory.html">memory</a> <b>page size</b> (bytes)
in my Linux system?</p>

<p class="cmd">getconf PAGESIZE</p>
<p>
<a name="env_vars"></a>
What <b>environment variables</b> are currently set (and their values)?</p>

<p class="cmd">set | less</p>
<p>
To find the current value of some specific env variable:</p>

<p class="cmdc">echo $HOME</p>
<p class="cmd">echo $PATH</p>
<p>
<a name="fd_num"></a>
The <b>number of file descriptors</b> used by the process with PID number
<kbd>pid</kbd>:</p>

<p class="cmdc">ls -l /proc/<span class="arg">pid</span>/fd</p>
<p class="cmd">ls -l /proc/<span class="arg">pid</span>/fd | wc -l</p>
<p>
<a name="proc_info"></a>
Miscellaneous process info (some of this cmds require <b>superuser</b> priv
if the current user is not the owner of the process):</p>

<p class="cmdc">cat /proc/2208/cmdline</p>
<p class="desc">command line args of the process with <samp>PID = 2208</samp>
(random PID, just for demo);</p>

<p class="cmdc">ls -l /proc/2208/cwd</p>
<p class="desc">current working dir of the process with <samp>PID = 2208</samp>;</p>

<p class="cmdc">ls -l /proc/2208/exe</p>
<p class="desc">executable file (full path to the binary executable of the process);</p>

<p class="cmdc">cat /proc/2208/environ</p>
<p class="desc">environment variables used by the process;</p>

<p class="cmdc">ls -l /proc/2208/root</p>
<p class="desc">the root path as seen by the process;</p>

<p class="cmdc">cat /proc/2208/status</p>
<p class="desc">status info (run state, memory usage, etc);</p>

<p class="cmdc">sudo pmap 4237</p>
<p class="desc">detailed info about memory used by the process
(<samp>pid = 4237</samp>);</p>

<p class="cmdc">sudo pmap 4237 | grep total</p>
<p class="desc">total size of memory used by the process;</p>
<p>
System-wide <b>maximum number of file handles</b>:</p>

<p class="cmdc">cat /proc/sys/fs/file-max</p>
<p class="or">or</p>
<p class="cmd">sysctl fs.file-max</p>
<p>
File descriptors in kernel memory (format: num of allocated file handles,
num of unused-but-allocated file handles, system-wide max num of file
handles):</p>

<p class="cmdc">cat /proc/sys/fs/file-nr</p>
<p class="or">or</p>
<p class="cmd">sysctl fs.file-nr</p>
<p>
See also <code><a href="cmds_c.html#cat">cat</a></code> usage examples.</p>



<h5>
<a name="libc"></a>How to find Libc (Glibc) version?</h5>
<p>
The simplest way is probably</p>

<p class="cmd">ldd --version</p>
<p>
Or, you can just look at that file in that dir with your own eyes:</p>

<p class="cmdc">ls -al /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc-*</p>
<p class="cmd">ls -al /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.*</p>



<h5>
<a name="lib_dep"></a>What libraries are used by this binary executable?</h5>
<p>
There are many ways. For example:</p>

<p class="cmdc">ldd ~/bin/digger</p>
<p class="or">or</p>
<p class="cmdc">objdump -p ~/bin/digger</p>
<p class="or">or</p>
<p class="cmd">lsof -P -T -p objdump -p <span class="arg">pid</span></p>
<p>
Note that the third cmd is only applicable to the running processes, while
the first two cmds query the executable file and work even when the program
cannot be started because of the unsatisfied dependencies.</p>
<p>
If <code>ldd</code> outputs "not a dynamic executable", it usually means that the executable is a static one, or it was built
for a different architecture, or some loader files are missing, or kernel version is too old, or library configurations are
incorrect. For example, it often happens with Go apps because they are usually statically linked.</p>



<h5>
<a name="kernel_version">Kernel version..</a></h5>
<p>
To find the current version of your <a href="kernel.html">Linux kernel</a>,
use the following cmds:</p>

<p class="cmdc">cat /proc/version</p>
<p class="or">or</p>
<p class="cmd">uname -r</p>
<p>
The last cmd only shows kernel release numbers, and usually it's enough.
But this cmd with a different option can give you even more info:</p>

<p class="cmd">uname -a</p>
<p>
displays</p>
<ul>
<li>Kernel name which is <samp>Linux</samp> for Linux, but can be different
on BSD or macOS.</li>
<li>Hostname (whatever you set).</li>
<li>Kernel release numbers. It's complicated and was changing over time.
Ubuntu kernel numbers are not exactly the same as the mainline Linux kernel
numbers, and, probably, you should only pay attention to the first three:
<ul class="tight">
<li>Kernel version</li>
<li>Major revision</li>
<li>Minor revision</li>
<li>Patch (bug fix) number</li>
<li>Some distribution specific word/string, aka <i>flavour</i>.
Some popular Ubuntu flavours are:
<ul class="tight">
<li><samp>generic</samp> - default kernel optimized for desktops;</li>
<li><samp>server</samp> - kernel optimized for servers;</li>
<li><samp>virtual</samp> - kernel optimized for for KVM, XEN, and EC2;</li>
</ul></li></ul></li>
<li>Kernel name, time of built, etc (smth like
<samp>#148~14.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Thu May 3 07:26:53 UTC 2018</samp></li>
<li>Machine architecture.</li>
<li>Processor architecture.</li>
<li>Operating system architecture (technically, you can run 32-bit
<samp>x86</samp> OS on a 64-bit <samp>x86_64</samp> CPU).</li>
<li>Operating system, which is usually <samp>GNU/Linux</samp> for Linux,
whatever distribution.</li>
</ul>
On my system <i>machine architecture</i>, <i>processor architecture</i>,
<i>OS architecture</i> are all the same, <samp>x86_64</samp>, and I guess
it's the most popular case.</p>



<h5>
<a name="find_fs_type">Filesystem type..</a></h5>
<p>
There are many ways to find the filesystem type. For example:</p>

<p class="cmd">df -Th</p>
<p>
It's good, except that it displays USB flash drive as <samp>fuseblk</samp>
instead of <samp>exfat</samp>.</p>

<p class="cmd">lsblk -f</p>
<p>
displays everything right but requires <samp>root</samp> priv (i.e., you
have to <code>sudo ...</code>).</p>

<p class="cmd">mount | grep "^/dev"</p>
<p>
also requires <samp>root</samp> priv and displays <samp>fuseblk</samp> instead
of <samp>exfat</samp>. The following is better (assuming your USB flash drive
is mounted on <samp>/dev/sdf1</samp>):</p>

<p class="cmd">blkid /dev/sdf1</p>
<p>
However, without <code>sudo</code> it shows nothing, and this could be
misleading. You can also use</p>

<p class="cmd">cat /etc/mtab</p>
<p>
but, once again, it displays USB flash drive fs as <samp>fuseblk</samp>
instead of <samp>exfat</samp>. And notice that all these cmds display FAT32
as <samp>vfat</samp> which is right. But, technically, it could be FAT16, and
besides, <samp>vfat</samp> is not actually a filesystem type, it's an
extension, kind of addition to FAT providing support for long file names.</p>
<p>
There is also <code>findmnt</code>:</p>

<p class="cmd">findmnt /dev/sda3</p>



<h5>
<a name="mount_opts">Filesystem's mount options</a></h5>
<p>
Assuming it's already mounted, and you want to know what are actual mount
options .. where to look?</p>
<p>
You can look in <samp>/etc/fstab</samp>, or you can examine <samp>/etc/mtab</samp>,
or you can try <samp>/proc/mounts</samp>. I prefer the last two because the
<samp>/etc/fstab</samp> is not the best source of information: you can edit it
(having <i>root</i> priv), make some minor mistakes, and something won't be
mounted as supposed.</p>
<p>
All the above files usually include too many lines. So, it would be good to
know beforehand what do you want (e.g. device name would be helpful):</p>

<p class="cmdc">cat /etc/mtab | grep sda</p>
<p class="cmdc">cat /etc/mtab | grep /dev/sdb1</p>
<p class="cmd">cat /proc/mounts | grep nvme</p>



<h5>
<a name="hw_mon">CPU temperature, fan speed, HDD temperature, ...</a></h5>
<p>
Make sure your system has<code> sensors </code>and<code> hddtemp</code>.
If not, see <a href="sw_inst.html#sensors">Hardware Monitoring / Sensors</a>.
To see the current HW parameters (or, to be exact, sensors' data),</p>

<p class="cmd">sensors</p>
<p>
This is a console app, the output is not exactly user friendly, but all
important info is present: temperatures, fan speeds, voltages, etc.</p>
<p>
<i><b>Note # 1</b>: It does not display fans connected directly to Power Supply
Unit! You can only see fans connected to motherboard!</i></p>
<p>
<i><b>Note # 2</b>: Your system may not support some sensor chips, and in this
case you won't be able to see all info supplied by sensors. You can try to run
<code>sensors-detect</code>, but it's not safe (see<code> man
sensors-detect</code>).</i></p> 
<p>
To find the temperatures of HDDs and SSDs,
use<code><a href="cmds_h.html#hddtemp"> hddtemp</a></code>:</p>

<p class="cmdc">sudo hddtemp /dev/sda</p>
<p class="cmd">sudo hddtemp /dev/sdb</p>
<p>
You can get even more info about storage devices with
<code><a href="cmds_s.html#smartctl">smartctl</a></code>.</p>



<h5>
<a name="mem_mmu">Memory Management Unit</a></h5>
<p>
See also <a href="memory.html">Memory</a>.</p>
<p>
MMU, sometimes called PMMU (paged memory management unit), is a computer
<b>hardware unit</b> having all memory references passed through itself,
primarily performing the translation of virtual memory addresses to physical
addresses.</p>
<p>
MMU performs virtual memory management, handling at the same time memory
protection, cache control, bus arbitration and, in simpler computer
architectures (e.g. 8-bit systems), bank switching.</p>
<p>
Typical MMU divides the virtual address space (the range of addresses used by
the processor) into <b>pages</b>, each having a size which is a power of
<samp>2</samp>, usually a few kilobytes or larger. The bottom bits of the
address (the offset within a page) are left unchanged. The upper address bits
are the virtual page numbers.</p>

<p id="show_mmu"><span class="ref">PTE, TLB, paging, segmentation fault...</span></p>

<div class="box1" id="mmu" style="display:none">
<p>
Most MMUs use an in-memory table of items called a <b>page table</b>, containing
one <i>page table entry</i> (PTE) per page, to map virtual page numbers to physical
page numbers in main memory. An associative cache of PTEs is called a <i>translation
lookaside buffer</i> (TLB) and is used to avoid the necessity of accessing the main
memory every time a virtual address is mapped. Other MMUs may have a private array
of memory or registers that hold a set of page table entries. The physical page
number is combined with the page offset to give the complete physical address.</p>
<p>
A PTE may also include info about whether the page has been written to (the
<i>dirty bit</i>), when it was last used (the <i>accessed bit</i>, for a least
recently used (LRU) page replacement algorithm), what kind of processes (<i>user
mode</i> or <i>supervisor</i> mode) may read and write it, and whether it should
be cached.</p>
<p>
Sometimes, a PTE prohibits access to a virtual page, perhaps because no physical
random access memory has been allocated to that virtual page. In this case, the MMU
signals a <b>page fault</b> to the CPU. The OS then handles the situation, perhaps
by trying to find a spare frame of RAM and set up a new PTE to map it to the requested
virtual address. If no RAM is free, it may be necessary to choose an existing page,
using some replacement algorithm, and save it to disk (a process called <b>paging</b>).
With some MMUs, there can also be a shortage of PTEs, in which case the OS will have
to free one for the new mapping.</p>
<p>
The MMU may also generate illegal access error conditions or <b>invalid page faults</b>
upon illegal or non-existing memory accesses, respectively, leading to <b>segmentation
fault</b> or <b>bus error</b> conditions when handled by OS.</p>
</div>



<h5>
<a name="service">Service vs daemon</a></h5>
<p>
The border line between <i>daemons</i> and <i>services</i> in Linux is fuzzy.</p>
<p>
The majority of experts would probably agree that<samp> systemd</samp>,<samp>
networkd</samp>,<samp> sshd </samp>are <i>daemons</i>. Not because their names
end with 'd' (this is rather a tradition), but because they are specifically
created to run at the background. Unix/Linux <i>daemons</i> (the name speaks
for itself) are invisible programs (maybe for user, but not for<code> ps
</code>or<code> top</code>) working somewhere inside a computer system and
magically performing important job.</p>
<p>
In fact, <b>daemon</b> is just a computer program that at some moment (usually
soon after start) disconnects itself from display and keyboard, writes some
(mostly diagnostic) messages into a log file, and you can only control it with
the help of another program, like<code> systemctl </code>or<code> kill
</code>(this name is awkward and misleading).</p>
<p>
The term <b>service</b> (in the sense <i>application</i>, <i>program</i>) came
in the Linux world relatively late, probably when a universal abstract idea of
<i>service</i> started to gain popularity due to the appearance of concrete
implementations like web-services (first SOAP, then REST).</p>
<p>
In general, Linux <b>service</b> is supposed to be something bigger, more
complicated, or, at least, more user-oriented than a <i>daemon</i>. Take, for
example, <i>Oracle database server</i>: Oracle instance runs simultaneously
more than ten processes handling shared memory segments, database files, redo
log (transaction journals), user's connections, etc. So, we would rather call
it a <i>service</i> than a daemon.</p>
<p>
Some experts, however, prefer to draw the line in accordance with the target
area: <i>daemons</i> serve the internal system needs, <i>services</i> work for
users.</p>
<p>
Technically, many Linux <i>services</i> are implemented as <i>daemons</i>.
But it can also be a <i>web-service</i> or a <i>web-application</i> packed into
a single big JAR that starts as a console app.</p>
<p>
However,</p>
<p class="center">
<i>For <b>systemd</b>, everything (i.e. any executable specified in a<samp>
*.service </samp>file) is <b>service</b>! It's just a terminology, and the above
discussion has nothing to do with it.</i></p>



<h5>
<a name="squashfs">Squashfs (filesystem type)</a></h5>
<p>
<b>Squashfs</b> is a compressed read-only file system for Linux. It compresses
files, inodes and directories, and supports block sizes from <samp>4</samp>
KiB up to <samp>1</samp> MiB (for better compression). Several compression
algorithms are supported. Squashfs is intended for general read-only
filesystem use and in constrained block-device memory systems (e.g. embedded
systems) where low overhead is needed.</p>
<p>
Since Linux kernel 4.14 <i>squashfs</i> supports <samp>GZIP</samp>,
<samp>LZMA</samp>, <samp>LZO</samp>, <samp>LZMA2</samp>, <samp>LZ4</samp>,
and <samp>Zstd</samp> compression.</p>
<p>
Many Live CDs use <i>squashfs</i>, e.g. Arch Linux, Debian, Fedora, Gentoo
Linux, Linux Mint, Ubuntu and other.</p>

<h5>
<a name="x86-64">x86-64</a></h5>
<p>
(based on Wikipedia article
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64" target="_top">x86-64</a>)</p>
<p>
<b>64-bit</b> architecture usually means <b>x86-64</b> when we talk
about personal computers and servers with Intel or AMD processors.</p>

<img class="float_right" src="images/AMD_Opteron_2005.jpg" />
<p>
The original x86-64 specification was released by AMD in 2000. It was later
implemented by Intel and VIA, but AMD K8 processor was the first CPU with
this architecture.</p>
<p>
<b>x86-64</b> (aka x64, x86_64, AMD64 and Intel 64) is the 64-bit version
of the x86 instruction set. It supports vastly larger amounts of virtual
and physical <a href="memory.html">memory</a> than 32-bit systems. It also
provides 64-bit general-purpose registers and numerous other enhancements.
x86-64 processors can boot in a fully backward compatible <b>legacy mode</b>,
without 64-bit support, for 16-bit and 32-bit x86 software that requires real
mode, or in a <b>compatibility mode</b> that allows 64-bit apps to coexist
with 16- and 32-bit protected mode software if the 64-bit system software
supports them. Since x86 16-bit &amp; 32-bit instruction sets remain
implemented in hardware without any intervening emulation, these older
executables can run with little or no performance penalty, while newer or
recoded apps can take advantage of new features.</p>
<p>
Intel's implementation of x86-64, known as <b>Intel 64</b>, has some minor
differences from AMD spec. This may be important for low-level system
programming, but regular app developers should not bother about it.</p>



<h5>
<a name="yaml">YAML</a></h5>
<p>
YAML is a <b>human-readable data-serialization language</b>. It is commonly
used for configuration files and in apps where data is being stored or
transmitted. YAML was supposed to replace XML (Extensible Markup Language) in
config files, like those config files used in Java EE, Spring Framework, etc.
YAML does not use XML/HTML <i>tags</i>, its syntax is shorter and simpler
than XML's. The acronym itself means "YAML Ain't Markup Language". Recursive,
in traditions of Open Soft.</p>
<p>
YAML uses Python-style indentation to indicate nesting, and a more compact
format with<samp> [] </samp>for lists and<samp> {} </samp>for maps making
YAML 1.2 a superset of JSON.</p>



<h5>
<a name="zero-copy">Zero-copy</a></h5>
<p>
describes computer operations in which the CPU does not perform the task
of copying data from one memory area to another.</p>
<p>
Zero-copy device drivers, file systems, and network protocol stacks greatly
increase performance of certain application programs and improve utilization
of the system resources. Performance is enhanced by allowing the CPU to move
on to other tasks while data copying proceeds in parallel. Also, zero-copy
operations reduce the number of mode switches between <i>user space</i> and
<i>kernel space</i>. System resources are utilized more efficiently because
the CPU does not have to waste time performing simple copy operations if
other system components can do this.</p>
<p>
Zero-copy protocols are especially important for high-speed networks in which
the capacity of a network link approaches or exceeds the CPU's processing
capacity. In this case CPU spends nearly all its time copying transferred data
and thus becomes a bottleneck limiting communication rate.</p>
<p>
Of course, zero-copy must be supported on the hardware level by technologies
like DMA (direct memory access), MMU (memory management unit), HSA
(Heterogeneous System Architecture, see x86-64 implementation on the picture
below).</p>

<img class="centered" src="images/hsa.png" />



<h4>
<a name="nvidia">nVidia &amp; Nouveau</a></h4>
<p>
<i>The following is only applicable to systems with nVidia card!</i></p>
<p>
Usually Linux (e.g. Ubuntu) comes with open-source <b>Nouveau</b> drivers for
Nvidia GPUs. But Nouveau is not good. <b>Nvidia proprietary drivers</b> are much
better. Nouveau is used by default unless you install proprietary driver, and
sometimes it's used even after you've installed proprietary driver. My system in
this case has screen size smaller than actual display size though resolution is
the same. And "Settings" shows "Graphics" like "llvmpipe .." instead of "NVIDIA ..".

<p>
Remove all nvidia drivers (Nouveau will stay, and GUI is not going to stop
working .. in most cases):</p>

<p class="cmd">sudo apt remove --purge '^nvidia-.*'</p>
<p>
Now, open "Software and Updates" from the App Menu, click the "Additional Drivers"
tab. Or, you can start "Additional Drivers" app if you have it (I have it on
Ubuntu 20.04).</p>
<p>
Wait for the app to download a list of additional drivers available for your
GPU. The driver installed on your machine is selected by default. It is usually
an open-source Nouveau display driver.</p>
<p>
From the list, select the latest Nvidia driver labeled <b>proprietary,
tested</b>.</p>
<p>
Click "Apply Changes", and wait for the installation to finish.</p>
<p>
Restart your system for the changes to take effect.</p>


<h5>More details</h5>
<p>
A [NVIDIA] meta-package is a type of package that contains info about other
packages to be installed. For that reason, installing the meta-package will
result in installing the packages it defines. The Nvidia meta-package not only
contains the driver but also the helper tools such as nvidia-smi (<b>System
Management Interface</b>). You can use it to find driver version and other
info:</p>

<p class="cmd">nvidia-smi</p>
<p>
There are other ways to get driver info.</p>

<p class="cmdc">grep "X Driver" /var/log/Xorg.0.log</p>
<p class="or">or</p>
<p class="cmd">cat /proc/driver/nvidia/version</p>

Also, you can use the <code>lspci</code> utility to retrieve module name:</p>

<p class="cmd">lspci -k | grep -A 2 -i "VGA"</p>
<p>
And you can display the specs of the video card like this:</p>

<p class="cmd">lshw -c video</p>
<p>
To list installed nvidia drivers:</p>

<p class="cmd">dpkg -l | grep -i nvidia</p>
<p>
To find all the available drivers for Nvidia [in repo]:</p>

<p class="cmd">apt search nvidia-*</p>
<p>
To remove all nvidia drivers from your system:

<p class="cmd">sudo apt remove --purge '^nvidia-.*'</p>
<p>
The <code>glxinfo</code> displays info about the <b>mesa driver</b>, which
is an open-source implementation of the <b>OpenGL</b> specification. It contains
info about graphics API specifications and also about the graphics card in use.</p>
<p>
The <code>glxinfo</code> is a helper utility, it does not come with the mesa
driver, but you can get it by installing the <samp>mesa-utils</samp> pkg from
the official repo:</p>

<p class="cmd">sudo apt install mesa-utils</p>
<p>
By default, <i>glxinfo</i> outputs much and you should probably use it with
<i>grep</i>:</p>
<p class="cmd">glxinfo | grep -iE 'vendor:|device:|version:'</p>
<div class="term"><pre>
Vendor: AMD Radeon Software
Device: Mesa DRI Radeon RX 570 (0x166)
Version: 21.1.5</pre></div>


<h5>About Intel drivers</h5>
<p>
The drivers for Intel on Linux are a bit confusing due to the conflict between
<b>Wayland</b> (new) and <b>X.Org</b> - old, traditional window system for Linux
(since 1984); Wayland is the intended security-focused replacement for X.Org and
does not support the drivers developed for X.Org.</p>
<p>So, there are different packages for Intel drivers that run under X.Org
(Xorg VESA, XF86-Video-Intel, Xorg Intel, etc). Most of these pkgs are ancient
and are not recommended for Intel GPUs anymore.</p>
<p>
To overcome the issues with those drivers, Tungsten Graphics introduced Mesa -
an open-source implementation of OpenGL, Vulkan, and other Graphics API specs.
Mesa works well with both Wayland and X.Org and is actively maintained.</p>
