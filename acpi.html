<p>
<b>Advanced Configuration and Power Interface</b> is an open industry
specification defining hardware &amp; software interfaces that enable
<b>OSPM</b> (OS-directed configuration and power management) to enumerate
and configure motherboard devices, and manage their power supply, consumption,
etc.</p>
<p>
ACPI replaces old <b>APM</b> (Advanced Power Management), the "MultiProcessor
spec" and the "Plug and Play BIOS spec". ACPI brings power management under
the control of the OS, as opposed to the old BIOS-centered system which relied
on platform-specific firmware to determine PM and config policy.</p>
<p>
ACPI has three main components:</p>
<ul>
<li>the ACPI tables (see <a href="#dsdt">DSDT</a>),</li>
<li>the ACPI BIOS,</li>
<li>the ACPI registers.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Unlike its predecessors (APM, PnP BIOS), the ACPI implements little of its
functionality in the ACPI BIOS code, whose main role is to load the ACPI tables
in system memory. Instead, most of the firmware ACPI functionality is provided
in ACPI Machine Language (<b>AML</b>) bytecode stored in the ACPI tables.</p>
<p>
To use these tables, OS must have an interpreter for the AML bytecode.
The ACPI Component Architecture (ACPICA) provides an open-source OS-independent
reference implementation of the OS-related ACPI code. The ACPICA code is used
by Linux and FreeBSD, which supplement it with their OS-specific code.</p>



<h4 class="part2">
<a name="dsdt">DSDT</a></h4>
<p>
(Differentiated System Description Table) is a part of ACPI spec.
It contains the <b>Differentiated Definition Block</b>, which supplies
the implementation and configuration info about the base system.
DSDT has definitions of all of devices that ACPI supports, and describes
their capabilities (e.g., the battery, AC Adapter, Embedded Controller,
Fans and Thermal Zones). This info is presented in a hierarchical manner,
so that ACPI (and OS) can be aware of dependency relationships among the
system hardware. The DSDT is loaded and inserted into the ACPI Namespace
at boot time and tells the ACPI drivers what to look for.</p>
<p>
An OEM must supply a DSDT to an ACPI-compatible OS (firmware from the
manufacturer).</p>
<p>
<b>The main problem</b>. The ACPI spec defines the requirements for the DSDT
(and everything else, for that matter) pretty explicitly. Intel's ASL compiler,
<samp>iasl</samp>, used to compile the DSDT from ASL (ACPI Source Language)
to AML (ACPI Machine Language) throws errors and warnings if the underlying
ASL is buggy. Unfortunately, Microsoft's ASL compiler allows many of these
errors and warnings to sneak by. As a result, many OEMs write buggy DSDTs,
and it turns out that Windows is very forgiving of bugs in the DSDT that get
by Microsoft's compiler.</p>
<p>
This means that a DSDT that does not conform to ACPI spec may work under
Windows. However, when you try to use it in Linux (where the ACPI developers
use Intel ASL compiler and expect DSDT to comply with the standard) the buggy
sections of the DSDT are unsupported and ACPI may not find some devices
(or some of their capabilites). If you have missing or incompletely supported
functionality in <samp>/proc/acpi</samp>, the cause may be a buggy DSDT.</p>
<p>
Usually, the presence of "MSFT" in the DSDT line in <samp>dmesg</samp> means
that your DSDT was compiled with the Microsoft compiler.</p>
<p>
In addition to the DSDT, laptops that conform to the ACPI 2.0 spec may provide
an <b>ECDT</b>. This is a small table that provides minimal info about the
Embedded Controller to the ACPI drivers before this section is parsed from
the DSDT. This is necessary to prevent some problems with device init (such as
the battery and AC adapter in some systems) that rely on the Embedded
Controller. However, some laptops that should provide an ECDT, do not. So,
to get around this, we'll have to patch the kernel to read the necessary
info from the DSDT.</p>
<p>
The latest ACPI patches (for vanilla source kernels) can be downloaded from
<a href="http://acpi.sourceforge.net">acpi.sourceforge.net</a>.



<h4 class="part2">
<a name="power_states">Power states</a></h4>
<p>
The ACPI spec defines the following four Global "Gx" states and six Sleep "Sx"
states for an ACPI-compliant computer-system. Global states are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>G0</b> - working (see S0);</li>
<li><b>G1</b> - sleeping (see S1, S2, S3, S4);</li>
<li><b>G2</b> - soft off (see S5);</li>
<li><b>G3</b> - mechanical off; the computer's power has been totally removed
via a mechanical switch (as on the rear of a PSU). The power cord can be
removed and the system is safe for disassembly (typically, only the real-time
clock continues to run - using its own small battery);</li>
</ul>
<p>
Sleep states are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>S0</b> - working; the system is fully usable, though hardware components
that are not in use can save power by entering a lower power state, i.e., if
the screen is off it's still S0;</li>
<li><b>S1</b> - Power on Suspend (POS); all the processor caches are flushed,
and the CPU(s) stops executing instructions; the power to the CPU(s) and RAM
is maintained; devices that do not indicate they must remain on, may be powered
off;</li>
<li><b>S2</b> - CPU powered off, dirty cache is flushed to RAM;</li>
<li><b>S3</b> - commonly referred as <b>Sleep</b> or <b>STR</b> (Suspend to
RAM); also known as <b>Standby</b>; RAM remains powered;</li>
<li><b>S4</b> - commonly referred as <b>Hibernate</b> or <b>STD</b> (Suspend
to Disk); all content of the main memory is saved to non-volatile memory such
as HDD, and is powered down;</li>
<li><b>S5</b> - soft off: G2/S5 is almost the same as G3 Mechanical
Off, except that the PSU still supplies power, at a minimum, to the power
button to allow return to S0. A full reboot is required. No previous content
is retained. Other components may remain powered so the computer can "wake"
on input from the keyboard, clock, modem, LAN, or USB device;</li>
</ul>
<p>
Note that states S1, S2, S3 are all commonly named "Sleep".</p>
<p>
There is also <b>Modern Standby</b> mode (aka "S0 low-power idle") supported
mostly by SoC (System on Chip). In this state, a system quickly switches from a
low-power state to a high-power state, and quickly responds to hardware/network
events. Systems supporting "Modern Standby" do not use S1-S3.</p>
<p>
ACPI spec also defines a <b>Legacy state</b>: the state on an OS which does not
support ACPI. In this state, the hardware and power are not managed via ACPI.</p>
