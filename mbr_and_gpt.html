<h2>
<a name="mbr">Master Boot Record</a></h2>
<p>
MBR can designate:</p>
<ul>
<li>the whole contents of a disk's first sector (CHS 0,0,1);</li>
<li>the boot loader occupying the first 446 bytes of that sector;</li>
<li>the classical partitioning format with 4 partitions max (e.g.,
3 primary partitions + 1 extended partition);</li>
</ul>


<h4 class="part3">MBR (cylinder 0, head 0, sector 1)</h4>
<p>
The first part of this sector (first 446 bytes) is occupied by the
Boot Loader code (some people call it MBR or MBR code). If this part
is damaged, OS cannot be loaded from this HDD in usual manner. However,
it does not mean that it cannot be loaded at all. There are ways to start
a boot loader from other media (like USB-flash) or to write the appropriate
code to this part of HDD. Anyway, these first 446 bytes are less important
than remaining 66 bytes containing partition table. That is, there are std
tools that can help you to restore the boot loader, but the partition table is
unique: to be able to restore it, you should first make an appropriate backup
of it (see <a href="cmds_d.html#dd">one of methods</a>).</p>


<h4 class="part3">
<a name="pt">Partition table</a></h4>
<p>
The second part of the sector is occupied by the Partition Table.
The Partition Table conforms to a standard layout that is independent of
the OS. Each entry is 16 bytes long, making a maximum of 4 entries
available. Each entry starts at a predetermined offset from the beginning
of the sector, as follows:</p>

<p class="fmtc"><samp>Partition 1 0x01BE (446)</samp></p>
<p class="fmtc"><samp>Partition 2 0x01CE (462)</samp></p>
<p class="fmtc"><samp>Partition 3 0x01DE (478)</samp></p>
<p class="fmt"><samp>Partition 4 0x01EE (494)</samp></p>
<p>
The last 2 bytes in the sector are a signature word for the sector and
are always <samp>0x55AA</samp>. When there are fewer than 4 partitions,
the remaining fields are all zeros.</p>

<a name="winmbr">How to restore MBR</h4></a>
<p>
An old solution was to boot DOS from floppy disk and execute:</p>

<p class="cmd">FDISK /MBR</p>
<p>
Since floppy drives and diskettes are rare now, you have to find some other
way. Luckily, moderm Linux distros usually come with MBR image hidden in
<samp>/usr/lib/syslinux</samp> or <samp>/usr/lib/syslinux/mbr</samp>. Thus,
you can start your system using Live CD/USB (e.g., Ubuntu Live CD or Ubuntu
Live USB, which are actually regular Ubuntu distros for OS installation),
then you just put MBR to the right place of the target disk
(<samp>/dev/sda</samp> is specified in the following cmd as an example):</p>

<p class="cmd">dd if=/usr/lib/syslinux/mbr/mbr.bin of=/dev/sda</p>
<p>
Some LiveCDs (like <strong>RIPLinux</strong>, <strong>Knoppix</strong>)
include a utility named <code>TestDisk</code> that also can restore DOS MBR.</p>

<p class="warn">Note!</p>
<p class="indent">
<i>Programs that erase or rewrite MBR do not (or, at least, should not)
change HDD's partition table!</i></p>

<a name="grub_floppy">How to create GRUB boot floppy</a></h4>

This is really obsolete. Get a floppy diskette
and a Linux-computer with a diskette drive:</p>

<h2>
<a name="gpt">GPT, UEFI, EFI</a></h2>
<p>
<b>GPT</b> (GUID Partition Table) is a standard for the layout of the
partition table on a physical hard disk. Since 2010 it is a subset of UEFI.</p>
<p>
The original <a name="efi"><b>EFI</b></a> (Extensible Firmware Interface)
specification was developed by Intel Corp. between 1998..2005. In the middle
of 2005 Intel stopped spec development (last version 1.10), and contributed it
to Unified EFI Forum. UEFI version 2.1 was released in 2007.</p>
<p>
<b>UEFI</b> (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) is a specification
that defines a software interface between OS and platform firmware. UEFI is
a more advanced and secure replacement for IBM PC BIOS firmware interface.
UEFI is not restricted to any specific processor architecture and can run on
top of (or instead of) older BIOS implementations.</p>
<p>
<b>ESP</b> (EFI System Partition) is a data storage device partition that
is used in computers adhering to the UEFI spec. Accessed by the UEFI firmware
when a computer is powered up, it stores UEFI apps and the files these apps
need to run, e.g., OS kernel. Supported partition table schemes include MBR,
GPT, and <i>El Torito</i> volumes on optical disks. UEFI defines a <b>specific
version (!) of the FAT</b> file system independently from the original FAT
spec. This specific version encompasses a variant of the FAT32 on ESPs, and
FAT16/FAT12 on removable media. ESP also provides space for a boot sector for
backward BIOS compatibility.</p>



<h4 class="part3">Some features</h4>
<p>
MBR-based partition table schemes insert the partitioning info in the
MBR. In a GPT, partition table info is stored in the GPT header, but to
maintain compatibility, GPT retains the MBR entry as the first sector on
the disk followed by a primary partition table header, the actual beginning
of a GPT.</p>
<p>
Like modern MBRs, GPTs use logical block addressing (LBA) in place of the
historical cylinder-head-sector (CHS) addressing. Legacy MBR info is contained
in LBA 0, the GPT header is in LBA 1, and the partition table itself follows.
64-bit Windows systems reserve 16,384 bytes (32 sectors) for the GPT, leaving
LBA 34 as the first usable sector on the disk.</p>

</table>
<p class="warn">Note!</p>
<p class="indent"><i>The copies of a partition table
(secondary GPT table) and header (secondary GPT header) are kept at the
end of the disk. Thus, GPT provides redundancy, writing the GPT header and
partition table both at the beginning and at the end of the disk.</i></p>



<h4 class="part3">
<a name="legacy_mbr">Protective MBR (Legacy MBR), LBA 0</a></h4>
<p>
A conventional GPT disk contains a <b>protective MBR</b> with a single
partition, of type <samp>0xEE</samp> (EFI GPT), defined. This partition
spans the entire size of the disk or 2 TiB, whichever is smaller.
The intent is to keep GPT-unaware OSes and utilities from trying to modify
the disk.</p>
<p>
A <b>hybrid MBR</b> is a variant on the normal protective MBR. A hybrid MBR
contains a type-<samp>0xEE</samp> partition, but it also contains up to three
additional primary partitions, which point to the same space that's marked out
by up to three GPT partitions. Hybrid MBRs are normally needed only on
BIOS-based computers, and should be avoided, when this is possible.</p>
<p>
If the disk exceeds 2 TiB (the maximum partition size supported by the 32-bit
LBAs of the legacy MBR, assuming a 512 byte block size), the size of this
partition is marked as 2 TiB, ignoring the rest of disk.</p>
<p>
Apple's Boot Camp Intel based Apple macs software creates a hybrid partition
table to allow the booting of Windows (which at the time of Boot Camp's
creation did not support GPT or EFI). In this system the protective partition
is reduced in size to cover from sector 1 to the sector before the first
regular partition included in the hybrid MBR. Additional MBR partitions are
then defined to correspond to the next three GPT partitions.</p>



<h4 class="part3">
<a name="gpt_header">Partition table header (LBA 1)</a></h4>
<p>
The partition table header defines the usable blocks on the disk. It also
defines the number and size of the partition entries that make up the
partition table. On 64-bit Windows Server 2003 machines, 128 partitions can
be created. There are 128 partition entries reserved, each 128 bytes long.
The EFI spec requires that a minimum of 16,384 bytes be reserved
for the partition table, so this gives space for 128 partition entries.</p>
<p>
The header contains the disk GUID (Globally Unique Identifier). It records
its own size and location (always LBA 1) and the size and location of the
secondary GPT header and table (always the last sectors on the disk).
Importantly, it also contains a CRC32 checksum for itself and for the
partition table, which may be verified by the firmware, bootloader and/or
operating system on boot. Because of this, <b>hex editors should not be used
to modify the contents of the GPT</b>. Such modification would render the
checksum invalid. In this case, the primary GPT may be overwritten with
the secondary one by disk recovery software. If both GPTs contain invalid
checksums, the disk would be unusable.</p>

<li>Windows Server 2008 (64-bit)</li>

<li>Windows 7 (64-bit)</li>
<li>Windows Server 2008 R2 (64-bit)</li>

Mac OS X (x86 / x86-64; since 10.4.0), FreeBSD (x86 / x86-64; since 7.0)

The GUIDs in this table use a little-endian byte order.</p>
<p>
Initially Linux did not have a separate partition type for its data
partitions, and used the same GUID for the data partitions as Windows.
This created problems when dual-booting Linux / Windows in UEFI-GPT setup.
The new GUID (Linux filesystem data) was defined jointly by <b>GPT fdisk</b>
and <b>GNU Parted</b> developers. GPT fdisk (<code>gdisk</code>) identifies
it as type <samp>8300</samp>.</p>
