<div id="main">

<h1 class="part">Apache (web-server)</h1>
<p>
See also <a href="tomcat.html">Apache Tomcat</a>.</p>


<h5>Maybe it's already installed. How to find?</h5>
<p>
The following cmds explain the situation with Apache. To be sure,
prepend them with <code>sudo</code>, though in many systems <i>status</i>
does not require <samp>root</samp> priv.</p>

<p class="cmd">systemctl status apache2</p>
<p>
In older systems without <samp>systemd</samp></p>

<p class="cmdc">service apache2 status</p>
<p class="or">or</p>
<p class="cmd">/etc/init.d/apache2 status</p>
<p>
If the output includes<samp> ... no such service</samp>, then Apache is not
installed.</p>
<p>
When Apache is running,</p>

<p class="cmd">ps ax | grep apache</p>
<p>
displays a number of lines like</p>
<div class="term">
<pre>
  ... /usr/sbin/apache2 -k start
  ... /usr/sbin/apache2 -k start
  ... ... ...</pre></div>
<p>
Also, when Apache is running, it usually responds to the browser's request</p>

<p class="cmd">http://localhost</p>
<p>
and displays its welcoming page, or some other page, if config was changed
after installation.</p>
<p>
You can find detailed info about Apache with:</p>

<p class="cmdc">man apache2</p>
<p class="cmdc">man apache2ctl</p>
<p class="cmdc">man a2enmod</p>
<p class="cmd">man a2ensite</p>
<p>
In most cases, no <i>manual</i> means no <i>program</i>.</p>


<h5>Before installation</h5>
<p>
It would be good for your web-server to have a real FQDN (fully qualified
domain name). To see your current situation, try:</p>

<p class="cmd">hostname --fqdn</p>
<p>
Even if this is going to be an internal server, you should probably use
some name resolution technology, like, e.g., <a href="net.html#mdns">mDNS</a>.
Using pure IPs within URLs will cause problems sooner or later.</p>
<p>
Also, check/change date/time and TZ (must correspond to the server's
location). To change time zone data in Ubuntu:</p>

<p class="cmd">dpkg-reconfigure tzdata</p>
<p>
It's especially important for a server accessible from the Internet.</p>


<h5>
<a name="apache_install">Installation</a></h5>
<p>
As usually,</p>

<p class="cmd">sudo apt update</p>
<p>
then install the package:</p>

<p class="cmd">sudo apt install apache2</p>
<p>
In the past it was <code>httpd</code> (HTTP daemon), but now they call it
<code>apache2</code>.</p>
<p>
Note that by default Apache web-server accepts connection requests
on <samp>80/tcp</samp>, and your <b>firewall must be configured</b>
appropriately.</p>


<h5>Startup/shutdown</h5>
<p>
In Ubuntu, it's usually configured to start auto after installation.
And there are, of course, well-known standard commands (most of them must be
prepended with <code>sudo</code>):</p>

<p class="cmdc">systemctl start apache2</p>
<p class="cmdc">systemctl stop apache2</p>
<p class="cmdc">systemctl restart apache2</p>
<p class="cmdc">systemctl reload apache2</p>
<p class="cmdc">systemctl status apache2</p>
<p class="cmdc">systemctl disable apache2</p>
<p class="cmd">systemctl enable apache2</p>
<p>
The last two cmds are used to control Apache service start at system boot.</p>
<p>
If your Linux does not use <samp>systemd</samp>, you can try</p>

<p class="cmdc">service apache2 start</p>
<p class="cmdc">service apache2 stop</p>
<p class="cmdc">service apache2 restart</p>
<p class="cmd">service apache2 status</p>
<p>
or, you can manage your web-server using its init script:</p>

<p class="cmdc">/etc/init.d/apache2 start</p>
<p class="cmdc">/etc/init.d/apache2 stop</p>
<p class="cmdc">/etc/init.d/apache2 restart</p>
<p class="cmdc">/etc/init.d/apache2 reload</p>
<p class="cmdc">/etc/init.d/apache2 force-reload</p>
<p class="cmd">/etc/init.d/apache2 status</p>
<p>
And, there is also <code>apache2ctl</code>, a shell script
(<samp>/usr/sbin/apache2ctl</samp>), aka Apache web-server's
<i>front-end</i>:</p>

<p class="cmdc">apache2ctl start</p>
<p class="cmdc">apache2ctl stop</p>
<p class="cmdc">apache2ctl status</p>
<p class="cmd">...</p>
<p>
The main binary file is <samp>/usr/bin/apache2</samp>, but you shouldn't
start it directly.




<h4>Configuration</h4>


<h5>Basic stuff</h5>
<p>
The main config file is <samp>/etc/apache2/apache2.conf</samp>, but it's
just the core; the whole config is the assembly of multiple files stored in
<samp>/etc/apache2</samp> and subdirs. For example, <samp>ports.conf</samp>
allows to change the listening port for connection requests
(<samp>80/tcp</samp> by default), <samp>envvars</samp> defines env variables,
etc.</p>
<p>
Many config tasks can be done (and should be done) by "helpers":</p>

<p class="cmdc">a2enmod</p>
<p class="cmdc">a2dismod</p>
<p class="cmdc">a2ensite</p>
<p class="cmdc">a2dissite</p>
<p class="cmdc">a2enconf</p>
<p class="cmd">a2disconf</p>
<p>
These are PERL scripts in <samp>/usr/sbin/</samp>. They manipulate symlinks
allowing to include/exclude misc config parts. For example, to allow access to
<samp>public_html</samp> in user's home dir(s), you do</p>

<p class="cmd">sudo a2enmod userdir</p>
<p>
and that script correctly modifes all necessary symlinks, so that
you (and any other regular user of your system) can have a web-site
in <samp>public_html</samp> dir within the home dir tree (i.e., in
<samp>~/public_html</samp>). Note that the <b>name</b>
(<samp>public_html</samp>) and the <b>location</b> (at the root of your
home dir) are <b>important!</b> And you must restart Apache after config
changes:</p>

<p class="cmd">sudo systemctl restart apache2</p>
<p>
To allow execution of web-applications/scripts in <samp>cgi-bin</samp>
(or <samp>/usr/lib/cgi-bin</samp>):</p>

<p class="cmd">sudo a2enmod cgi</p>
<p>
The default document root is <samp>/var/www/html</samp>. By default,
web-browsers are not allowed to access files outside the document root,
<samp>~/public_html</samp> and <samp>/usr/share</samp> (web-apps only).</p>


<h5>Log files, user/group, etc</h5>
<p>
By default (see <samp>/etc/apache2/envvars</samp> for details), Apache process
belongs to user <samp>www-data</samp>, group <samp>www-data</samp>. Log files
reside in</p>

<p class="fmt"><samp>/var/log/apache2/</samp></p>

<p class="warn">Note!</p>
<p class="indent">If your <samp>/var/log/</samp> is <b>tmpfs</b> (which is
typical when OS resides on SSD), then you will have problems with the default
Apache config. It looks like <samp>/var/log/apache2/</samp> is created by
installation procedure and disappears during reboot. Apache daemon does not
try to re-create that dir, it just complains about missing log dir and rejects
to start.</p>
<p>
There are at least two simple solutions: you can manually create
<samp>/var/log/apache2/</samp> (ownership: <samp>root.root</samp>) each
time after reboot, and then manually start Apache; or, you can modify
<samp>/etc/apache2/apache2.conf</samp> and move log files to some non-volatile
locaction, e.g., <samp>/var/local/apache2/</samp>.</p>


<h5>Virtual hosting</h5>
<p>
feature provides hosting for multiple domains (multiple web-sites) deployed
on a single server. To set a virtual domain you need, of course, a registered
domain name (it's a separate story). The following example uses
<samp>mydomain.com</samp> which is obviously just for demo!</p>
<p>
First of all, you create a directory named similarly to your domain name,
then you create <samp>html</samp> subdir within this dir. There are many ways
to perform this task, for example:</p>

<p class="cmd">sudo mkdir -p /var/www/mydomain.com/html</p>
<p>
The <code>-p</code> options is used to create both dirs in one step
(see <code><a href="cmds_m.html#mkdir">mkdir</a></code> for details).</p>
<p>
The next step is to set correct ownership and permissions:</p>

<p class="cmd">sudo chown -R <span class="arg">username</span>:<span class="arg">groupname</span> /var/www/mydomain.com</p>
<p>
Permissions [for dirs] must be <samp>755</samp>. If not, use
<code><a href="cmds_c.html#chmod">chmod</a></code>:</p>

<p class="cmd">sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/mydomain.com</p>
<p>
Now, you can already move all prepared content into
<samp>/var/www/mydomain.com/html</samp>, or, at least, put there some
<samp>index.html</samp> file appropriate for testing.</p>
<p>
After that, comes the most tricky part: you have to create a config file
in <samp>/etc/apache2/sites-available</samp> dir; the name of the file should
correspond to the virtual domain name, i.e., <samp>mydomain.com.conf</samp>.
Probably, it's not a strict requirement (?) but a reasonable recommendation.
Carefully check each line before testing.</p>
<div class="file">
<pre>
&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
    ServerAdmin admin@mydomain.com
    ServerName mydomain.com
    ServerAlias www.mydomain.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/mydomain.com/html
    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</pre></div>
<p>
Note that the <samp>ServerName</samp> in the file above has nothing to do
with the name of the real server storing all this stuff.</p>
<p>
To activate (enable) this new site:</p>

<p class="cmd">sudo a2ensite mydomain.com.conf</p>
<p>
Also, you should disable the default virtual site (which is a useful template
for virtual host config files with explanations of misc options):</p>

<p class="cmd">sudo a2dissite 000-default.conf</p>
<p>
And the last two steps (assuming there is no erros in config):</p>

<p class="cmd">sudo apache2ctl configtest</p>
<p class="cmd">sudo systemctl restart apache2</p>


<h5>SSL with self-signed certificate</h5>
<p>
I skip the details of certificate creation ...
see <a href="cmds_o.html#openssl">openssl</a>. Here is a command:</p>

<p class="cmd">sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout
/etc/ssl/private/apache.key -out /etc/ssl/certs/apache.crt</p>
<p>
It creates a new private RSA key,</p>

<p class="fmt"><samp>/etc/ssl/private/apache.key</samp></p>
<p>
which is used to sign the certificate:</p>

<p class="fmt"><samp>/etc/ssl/certs/apache.crt</samp></p>
<p>
Now create <samp>/etc/apache2/conf-available/ssl-params.conf</samp> file with
the following content:</p>
<div class="file"><pre>
SSLCipherSuite EECDH+AESGCM:EDH+AESGCM:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH
SSLProtocol All -SSLv2 -SSLv3 -TLSv1 -TLSv1.1
SSLHonorCipherOrder On
Header always set X-Frame-Options DENY
Header always set X-Content-Type-Options nosniff
SSLCompression off
SSLUseStapling on
SSLStaplingCache "shmcb:logs/stapling-cache(150000)"
SSLSessionTickets Off
</pre></div>
<p>
Open <samp>/etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl.conf</samp> (the default
SSL Virtual Host file) and make sure the following lines point to your certificate
and key:</p>
<div class="file"><pre>
SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/certs/apache.crt
SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/private/apache.key
</pre></div>
<p>
Check <samp>ServerName</samp>, <samp>ServerAdmin</samp>, and
<samp>DocumentRoot</samp>. They must be the same as in
<samp>000-default.conf</samp> (assuming it was working good before).</p>
<p>
To redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS, add the following lines to
<samp>/etc/apache2/apache2.conf</samp> file:</p>
<div class="file"><pre>
RewriteEngine On 
RewriteCond %{SERVER_PORT} 80 
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://www.yourdomain.com/$1 [R,L]
</pre></div>
<p>
Note that if your system uses a firewal, it must accept requests on
<samp>tcp/443</samp>.</p>
<p>
To activate the new config, restart service:</p>

<p class="cmd">sudo systemctl restart apache2</p>
<p>
If it fails, and in <samp>/var/syslog</samp> you see an error like</p>
<div class="term"><pre>
Invalid command 'RewriteEngine', perhaps misspelled or
  defined by a module not included ...
</pre></div>
<p>
most likely it means you need to enable the <i>Rewrite</i> module:</p>

<p class="cmd">sudo a2enmod rewrite</p>
<p>
If Apache starts good, it still does not mean everything is OK. Use</p>

<p class="cmd">ss -nlt</p>
<p>
to be sure that web-server listens on <samp>tcp/443</samp>. If not, the problem
is usually related to modules. First, you need to enable the SSL module:</p>

<p class="cmd">sudo a2enmod ssl</p>
<p>
Then you need to enable the site:</p>

<p class="cmd">sudo a2ensite default-ssl.conf</p>
<p>
After that restart the service again.</p>
<p>
Do not forget that your web-server has a <b>self-signed certificate</b>.
It means that when you try to connect, your <b>browser will throw some disturbing
warning</b>, and you must accept the risk. It may look bad, but technically you
just acknowledge the validity of your own certificate which cannot be acknowledged
by a real trustworthy CA (Certification Authority).</p>


<!--
<p>
First of all, we need a certficate for Apache (mail service requires
passwords, password over HTTP requires SSL, and SSL requires certificates).
Self-signed certificate is bad for a big, serious, crictical, financial, etc.
system, but this is (what can I say?) very popular choice for simple, local,
internal, experimental, ... system. So be it, let's create this trivial,
self-made, <b>self-signed certificate</b> (which, besides all, should not
request a password when Apache starts):</p>

<p class="cmd">openssl req -new > new.cert.csr</p>
<p>
At this point we'll be prompted to enter some info about organization,
PEM pass phrase (prepare beforehand), etc:</p>

<p class="fmt">...</p>
<p>
If this stage is O.K., let's do the rest:</p>

<p class="cmd">openssl rsa -in privkey.pem -out new.cert.key</p>
<p class="cmd">openssl x509 -in new.cert.csr -out new.cert.cert -req -signkey new.cert.key -days 1825</p>
<p>
If there is no <samp>ssl</samp> dir in <samp>/etc/apache2</samp>,
create it (or, if you prefer <samp>/etc/ssl</samp>, modify config):</p>

<p class="cmd">cp new.cert.cert /etc/apache2/ssl/server.crt</p>
<p class="cmd">cp new.cert.key /etc/apache2/ssl/server.key</p>
<p>
Now we must configure DNS for a first domain to be able to address the
server. Use <code>a2enmod</code> apache2 module config script:</p>

<p class="cmd">a2enmod rewrite</p>
<p class="cmd">a2enmod ssl</p>
<p>
All unnecessary files from <samp>/var/www/</samp> (most likely
<samp>index.html</samp>) should be deleted or moved to some arc location
(postpone this step to be able to test the web server access),
and some new dirs (for future use) should be created:</p>

<p class="cmd">mkdir /var/www/webmail</p>
<p class="cmd">mkdir /var/www/mysql</p>
<p>
Ubuntu 11.10 installation usually includes two templates:</p>

<p class="fmtc"><samp>/etc/apache2/sites-available/default</samp></p>
<p class="fmt"><samp>/etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl</samp></p>
<p>
Edit one of them (<samp>default-ssl</samp> is more appropriate in our case),
or create totally new, but remember, web server will only read files
referenced by symlinks in <samp>/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/</samp> dir,
be sure the symlink points to the right file. Actually, there are
scripts <code>a2ensite</code> and <code>a2dissite</code> to handle this
situation.</p>
<p>
There are many ways to set options in this file, see, for example,
<a href="file_default.html"><samp>/etc/apache2/sites-available/default</samp></a>
(if you take it, replace names of files, certificates, etc). This config
allows access through the standard tcp/80 port and tcp/443 port (SSL).</p>
<p>
Also, we have to set some basic rules in<br>
<samp>/etc/apache2/conf.d/security</samp>:</p>

<div class="file">
<pre>&lt;Directory&gt;
  AllowOverride None
  Order Deny,Allow
  Deny from all
&lt;/Directory&gt;

ServerTokens Prod

ServerSignature Off</pre>
</div>
<p>
Restart Apache and test web server access from the net:</p>

<p class="cmd">/etc/init.d/apache2 restart</p>
<p>
Check/change PHP config <samp>/etc/php5/apache2/php.ini</samp>, pay
attention to the following params:</p>
<div class="file">
<pre>display_errors = off
upload_max_filesize = 20M
date.timezone = Europe/Rome</pre>
</div>
<p>
Enable default site (<code>a2ensite</code> creates symlinks, but it would
make no harm if all those symlinks were created manually):</p>

<p class="cmd">a2ensite default</p>
<p>
Once again restart Apache.</p>
