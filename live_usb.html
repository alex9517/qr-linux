<p>
The majority of modern computers support booting from <b>Live USB</b> - a
special USB flash drive containing the bootable image of the operating system.
Live USBs have some limitations that you should probably remember about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some systems (e.g., Ubuntu Linux) apply all filesystem writes to a
<i>casper filesystem overlay</i> (casper-rw) that, once out space, becomes
unusable and unbootable.</li>
<li>USB controllers on add-in cards are almost never capable of booting OS.
In other words, always use the USB port on the motherboard.</li>
<li>Old computers may not have BIOS support for USB booting.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Persistence</b> in the context of Live USB flash drive means that you
can save some changes and settings on the same USB flash drive you started
your system from. Linux Live USBs implement persistence by creating
a separate partition aside the main partition containing the system image.
Some Live USBs allow to update their system except kernel and initrd.</p>



<h4 class="part2">
<a name="ubuntu_usb">Ubuntu Linux Live USB</a></h4>
<p>
Starting with Ubuntu 11.10 release, Ubuntu ISO images became "hybrid",
i.e., suitable for both CD and USB flash drive creation.</p>
<p>
To create a bootable USB flash drive intended for installing Ubuntu
or using it as a Live USB, exec one of the following cmds (note that
<b>these cmds delete all data on the USB drive</b>):</p>

<p class="cmdc">sudo dd if=ubuntu-19.04-desktop-amd64.iso of=/dev/sdf bs=1048576</p>
<p class="or">or</p>
<p class="cmd">sudo dd if=ubuntu-19.04-desktop-amd64.iso of=/dev/sdf oflag=direct bs=1048576</p>
<p>
It can take several minutes and may not display anything except the final
message. <b>Device name, ISO name may be different!</b>.</p>
<p>
To find device name (<b>bad choice may lead to disaster!</b>), insert some
good USB flash drive into USB port, wait several seconds while its filesystem
is being mounted, and exec <code>df</code>. If this is the USB flash you're
going to put ISO image on, you don't have to unmount it before running the
above cmd. But you should try to unmount it after image writing, if system
shows it as mounted.</p>
<p>
The <samp>oflag=direct</samp> option can speed up the process,
however it's not always supported.</p>
<!--
<p>
The <b>persistence</b> file in <b>boot partition</b> is <samp>casper-rw</samp>.
So, if you create a separate persistence partition (hint: primary partition,
<samp>ext4</samp> without journalling) instead of this file, it must have
label <samp>casper-rw</samp>. It looks like this fs mounts auto. <b>Don't
forget to delete casper-rw file!</b></p>
<p>
The boot partition is <samp>fat32</samp>, label <samp>UUI</samp>, flags
<samp>boot,lba</samp>. Use <code>gparted</code> to decrease boot partition
size and get space for persistence fs.</p>



<a name="mint17">
<h4 class="part2">Linux Mint Live USB</h4></a>
<p>
Starting with release 12, Linux Mint
(<a href="http://www.linuxmint.com" target="_top">www.linuxmint.com</a>)
switched to Hybrid ISO images, that can be written directly to USB drive
(or to DVD):</p>

<p class="cmd">sudo dd if=linuxmint.iso of=/dev/sd<kbd>x</kbd> bs=1048576</p>
<p class="ind">or</p>
<p class="cmd">sudo dd if=linuxmint.iso of=/dev/sd<kbd>x</kbd> oflag=direct bs=1048576</p>
<p>
Note, that this method deletes all data on the USB drive, and system is not
persistent. The <b>persistence</b> is organized the same way as in Ubuntu
(see prev chapter).</p>

<h4 class="part2">
<a name="kali">Kali Linux Live USB</a></h4>
<p>
Download <i>current stable release</i> from the <b>official sites</b>:</p>
<p class="menu" style="font-size:110%">
<a href="https://www.kali.org" target="_top">www.kali.org</a>
&nbsp;&nbsp;///&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="https://cdimage.kali.org/current">Kali "Live CD Image"</a>.</p>
<p>
Simple (without persistence) Kali Live USB requires at least <samp>4Gb</samp>.
If you're planning persistence, get a USB flash drive with at least
<samp>8Gb</samp> capacity.</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and verify Kali ISO file
(see <a href="#kali_verify_1">Simple ISO verification procedure</a>).</li>

<li>Plug an appropriate USB flash drive into an available USB port. Don't
care about erasing, formatting, mounting, unmounting.</li>

<li>Check twice the name of the device you're going to write to, because
an error can lead to devastating consequencies.</li>

<li>
Assuming that the target USB flash drive is <samp>/dev/sdf</samp>, and the
downloaded image file is <samp>kali-linux-2022.1-live-amd64.iso</samp>, the cmd
should be:</li>
</ol>
<p class="cmd">
sudo dd if=kali-linux-2022.1-live-amd64.iso of=/dev/sdf conv=fsync bs=4M</p>
<p>
Notice <code>sudo</code>, - you cannot perform this procedure without root
privilege. And be patient: in general, it takes ~ 10&#177; minutes for an
average USB 2.0 drive, and all this time <code>dd</code> outputs nothing
(unless some error happens). Finally you will get something like (numbers can
be different):</p>
<div class="file">
<pre>
886+1 records in
886+1 records out
3718328320 bytes (3.7 GB, 3.5 GiB) copied, 632.291 s, 5.9 MB/s</pre>
</div>
<p>
Or, you can try to run it with status indicator:</p>
<p class="cmd">
sudo dd if=kali-linux-2022.1-live-amd64.iso of=/dev/sdf conv=fsync bs=4M status=progress</p>
<p>
When you start Kali from Live USB, make sure your BIOS is set to boot
from the proper USB device. When the Kali boot screen appears, select "Live
boot" from the menu. The default root password is "toor" (very funny).</p>


<h5>
<a name="kali_verify_1">Simple ISO verification procedure</a></h5>
<p>
Make sure you download ISO image from the official site
<a href="https://www.kali.org" target="_top">www.kali.org</a>.</p>
<p>
Generate the SHA256 checksum from the ISO image you've downloaded using
the following command:</p>

<p class="cmd">shasum -a 256 kali-linux-2019.1-amd64.iso</p>
<p>
The output must be (for this version and this archive):</p>

<p class="fmt"><samp>5596f2b5da66a45a6e6d14510cedc3fc20980f21d01c18059809ef651e6726dd</samp></p>
<p>
To be exact, you should compare the result of the above cmd with the
<b>sha256sum</b> number on the <samp>www.kali.org</samp> web site, and make
sure you take the number related to the ISO image you've downloaded.</p>

<!--
<p>
Latest: Kali Linux 64-bit 2019.1, 3.2G</p>
<p>
sha256sum:
<samp>5596f2b5da66a45a6e6d14510cedc3fc20980f21d01c18059809ef651e6726dd</samp></p>
-->


<h5>
<a name="kali_verify_2">More reliable ISO verification procedure</a></h5>
<p>
For this verification procedure you need three files, or, assuming that
you've already downloaded ISO image, <b>two files tightly related to that
ISO image</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li><samp>SHA256SUMS</samp>, the file containing the calculated SHA256 hash
for the ISO (actually, it contains hashes for all images of the same release);</li>
<li><samp>SHA256SUMS.gpg</samp>, the file containing the digital signature
protecting the above file from illegal, malicious, etc. modifications;</li>
</ul>
<p>
All files can be downloaded from
<a href="https://cdimage.kali.org/current">Kali "Live CD Image"</a> site.</p>
<p>
As in the prev (simple) case, ISO image is verified with a hash corresponding
to that image. But in this case the hash is taken from <samp>SHA256SUMS</samp>
file. To be sure that the file is the "right" one, i.e., the file with hashes
generated by Kali developers, you have to use a detached digital signature
contained in <samp>SHA256SUMS.gpg</samp> file.</p>
<p>
And, to complicate the situation even more, you need Kali's official key
downloaded and imported into your keychain. Unless you've already done it
(for your current system), the command is like this:</p>

<p class="cmdc">wget -q -O - https://www.kali.org/archive-key.asc | gpg --import</p>

<p class="or">or</p>

<p class="cmd">gpg --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net --recv-key 7D8D0BF6</p>
<p>
The output will be something like</p>
<div class="file">
<pre>
gpg: key 7D8D0BF6: "Kali Linux Repository &lt;devel@kali.org&gt;" 2 new signatures
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:         new signatures: 2
</pre></div>
<p>
Now, you should verify that the key is properly installed:</p>

<p class="cmd">gpg --fingerprint 7D8D0BF6</p>
<p>
The output must be something like</p>
<div class="file">
<pre>
pub   4096R/7D8D0BF6 2012-03-05 [expires: 2021-02-03]
      Key fingerprint = 44C6 513A 8E4F B3D3 0875  F758 ED44 4FF0 7D8D 0BF6
uid                  Kali Linux Repository &lt;devel@kali.org&gt;
sub   4096R/FC0D0DCB 2012-03-05 [expires: 2021-02-03]
</pre></div>
<p>
The next step is to check that <samp>SHA256SUMS</samp> is exactly the
same file that was created by Kali developers and signed with
<samp>SHA256SUMS.gpg</samp>:</p>

<p class="cmd">gpg --verify SHA256SUMS.gpg SHA256SUMS</p>

<div class="file">
<pre>
gpg: Signature made ... ... ... using RSA key ID 7D8D0BF6
gpg: Good signature from "Kali Linux Repository &lt;devel@kali.org&gt;"</pre>
</div>
<!--
The "not certified with a trusted signature..." message just means that
you haven't used your own private key to sign the ... key as trusted.
-->
<p>
If you don't get "Good signature", you probably made some mistake, maybe
downloaded SHA files for some other version of ISO image. Or, maybe, somebody
tries to trick you and thrust upon you bad files. Let's hope it's not the
case.</p>
<p>
The additional message like</p>

<p class="fmt"><samp>gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted
signature!</samp></p>
<p>
can be ignored ... experts say.</p>
<p>
If the signature is good, you can verify the downloaded ISO image:</p>

<p class="cmd">grep kali-linux-2019.1-amd64.iso SHA256SUMS | shasum -a 256 -c</p>
<p>
and the output must be:</p>
<div class="file">
<pre>
kali-linux-2019.1-amd64.iso: OK
</pre></div>


<h5>Persistence</h5>
<p>
is the preservation of data on the Live USB drive across reboots. To use this
feature, you need a USB flash drive with at least <samp>8GB</samp>: the system
image will take <samp>3GB+</samp>, and <samp>4GB</samp> will be used by
separate partition for the persistent data.</p>
<p>
If you created Kali Live USB as described above, that USB flash drive already
has two partitions. Assuming that your USB flash drive is
<samp>/dev/sdf</samp>, you can check it with:</p>

<p class="cmd">sudo fdisk -l /dev/sdf</p>
<p>
Now you must create and format one more partition, a new Linux partition,
code <samp>83</samp> with <samp>ext3</samp> filesystem. Here is the standard
way:</p>

<p class="cmd">sudo fdisk /dev/sdf</p>
<p>
(see <code><a href="cmds_f.html#fdisk">fdisk</a></code> for details)</p>
<p>
Use all available space, don't forget to write changes, and probably you will
have to unmount, eject (unplug) flash drive, then plug it again to refresh
kernel's partition table. After that, create filesystem:</p>

<p class="cmd">sudo mkfs.ext3 -L persistence /dev/sdf3</p>
<p>
You can use the following (optional) cmd to make sure that fs is OK,
and fs label is "persistence":</p>

<p class="cmd">sudo e2label /dev/sdf3</p>
<p>
The last step is to create <samp>persistence.conf</samp> file in that new
filesystem. Do it as you like, just be careful with the simple content of that
file:</p>

<p class="cmdc">sudo -s</p>
<p class="cmdc">mount /dev/sdf3 /mnt</p>
<p class="cmdc">cd /mnt</p>
<p class="cmdc">echo "/ union" &gt; persistence.conf</p>
<p class="cmdc">cd</p>
<p class="cmd">umount /dev/sdf3</p>

<!--
<p>
Plug the USB stick into the computer you want to boot up. Make sure your
BIOS is set to boot from the proper USB device. When the Kali boot screen
appears, select "Live boot" from the menu
(don't press <span class="keys">Enter</span>), and press the
<span class="keys">Tab</span> button. This will allow you to edit the boot
params. Add the word "persistence" to the end of the boot param line each
time you want to mount your persistent storage.</p>
