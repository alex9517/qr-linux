<h4>
<a name="files">Files and Dirs</a></h4>

<h5>Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)</h5>
<p>
The <b>FHS</b> defines the dir struct and dir contents in Unix and Unix-like
OSs. It's maintained by the Linux Foundation. The latest version is 3.0,
released on 3 June 2015. Currently it's only used by Linux distributions.</p>
<p>
In the FHS all files and dirs appear under the root dir, even if they
are stored on different physical or virtual devices.</p>

<table class="grid">
<tr>
<th class="grid_2">Directory</th>
<th class="grid_2">Purpose</th></tr>
<tr>
<td class="grid_2"><samp>/</samp></td><td class="grid_2">
Primary hierarchy root and root dir of the entire filesystem hierarchy.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td class="grid_2"><samp>/bin</samp></td><td class="grid_2">

Host-specific system-wide config files.
There has been controversy over the meaning of the name itself. In early
versions of the UNIX Implementation Document from Bell labs, <samp>/etc</samp>
is referred to as the etcetera dir, as this dir historically held everything
that did not belong elsewhere (however, the FHS restricts <samp>/etc</samp> to
static config files and may not contain binaries). Since the publication of
early doc, the dir name has been re-explained in various ways. Recent
interpretations include backronyms such as "Editable Text Configuration" or
"Extended Tool Chest".</td></tr>

Some distributions that generally follow the standard deviate from it in
some areas. Common deviations include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Modern Linux distributions include a <samp>/sys</samp> directory as
a virtual filesystem (<samp>sysfs</samp>, comparable to <samp>/proc</samp>,
which is a <samp>procfs</samp>) that stores and allows modification of the
devices connected to the system, whereas many traditional UNIX and Unix-like
OSs use <samp>/sys</samp> as a symbolic link to the kernel source tree.</li>
<li>Many modern UNIX systems (like FreeBSD via its ports system) install
third party packages into <samp>/usr/local</samp> dir while keeping the code
considered as the part of the system in <samp>/usr</samp> dir.</li>
<li>Some Linux distributions no longer differentiate between <samp>/lib</samp>
versus <samp>/usr/lib</samp> and have <samp>/lib</samp> symlinked to
<samp>/usr/lib</samp>.</li>
<li>Some Linux distributions no longer differentiate between <samp>/bin</samp>
vs <samp>/usr/bin</samp> and <samp>/sbin</samp> vs <samp>/usr/sbin</samp>.
They symlink ... And <samp>/usr/sbin</samp> may get symlinked to
<samp>/usr/bin</samp>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Modern Linux distros include a <samp>/run</samp> dir as a temporary filesystem
(<samp>tmpfs</samp>) which stores volatile runtime data, following the FHS
version 3.0. According to the FHS version 2.3, such data were stored in
<samp>/var/run</samp> but this was a problem in some cases because this dir
isn't always available at early boot. As a result, these programs have had to
resort to trickery, such as using <samp>/dev/.udev</samp>,
<samp>/dev/.mdadm</samp>, etc, even though the device dir isn't intended for
such data. Among other advantages, this makes the system easier to use normally
with the root fs mounted read-only. Below are the changes Debian made in its
2013 Wheezy release:</p>
<ul>
<li><samp>/dev/.* â†’ /run/*</samp></li>
<li><samp>/dev/shm â†’ /run/shm</samp></li>
<li><samp>/dev/shm/* â†’ /run/*</samp></li>
<li><samp>/etc/* (writeable files) â†’ /run/*</samp></li>
<li><samp>/lib/init/rw â†’ /run</samp></li>
<li><samp>/var/lock â†’ /run/lock</samp></li>
<li><samp>/var/run â†’ /run</samp></li>
<li><samp>/tmp â†’ /run/tmp</samp></li>
</ul>


<h5>
<a name="passwd_hash">About password hash</a></h5>
<p>
<samp>/etc/shadow</samp> stores password hashes (if account has password).
The type of the hash function can be (?) defined from the prefix:</p>
<ul>
<li><samp>$1$</samp> : MD5</li>
<li><samp>$2$</samp> : Bcrypt
<ul>
<li><samp>$2a$</samp> : Bcrypt, 1999</li>
<li><samp>$2x$</samp>, <samp>$2y$</samp> : Bcrypt, 2011</li>
<li><samp>$2b$</samp> : Bcrypt, 2014</li>
</ul></li>
<li><samp>$sha1$</samp> : SHA-1</li>

Linux uses the concept of "rotating" log files instead of purging or
deleting them. When a log is rotated (usually once a week, though there are
exceptions), a new log file is created and the old one is renamed (optionally
compressed). The number of backlogs is limited (usually <samp>4</samp>),
the oldest are auto deleted.</p>
<p>
The rotation is initiated through the logrotate utility. See config in
<samp>/etc/logrotate.conf</samp> and <samp>/etc/logrotate.d/</samp>.</p>


<h5>
<a name="tmpdirs">About temporary directories</a></h5>
<p>
In Unix and Linux, the global temp dirs are:</p>

<p class="fmtc"><samp>/tmp</samp></p>
<p class="fmt"><samp>/var/tmp</samp></p>
<p>
Typically, the last is for persistent files (to be preserved over reboots),
while <samp>/tmp</samp> is for files that are allowed to disappear during
reboot.</p>
<p>
You can force apps to use a different location for temp stuff.
<samp>TMPDIR</samp> is the canonical Unix env variable that should be
used to specify a temp dir for scratch space. Most Unix/Linux programs
honor this setting, some do not.</p>
