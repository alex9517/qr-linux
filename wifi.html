<h4>
<a name="access_point">Access Points and Routers</a></h4>
<p>
<i><b>A home net usually needs a WiFi router</b></i>.</p>
<p>
<i>Access Points are mostly for companies and larger networks.</i></p>
<p>
<b>WiFi router</b> acts as a hub that sets up a local area network and
provides wired and wireless connections for the devices. <b>Access Point</b> (AP)
is a wireless network device that connects laptops, smartphones, WiFi adapters, etc
to a local area network. You can also consider Access Point as a <i>sub-device</i>
within the local area network that can be used to extend the wireless coverage of
an existing network and/or to allow the larger number of users to connect to that
network.</p>
<p>
The term 'Access Point' is widely used in wireless technology, and a hardware
device providing the functionality of 'Access Point' (as described above) is just
a case.</p>
<p>
Note that <i>WiFi router</i> is an <i>Access Point</i> by definition. But opposite
is not true: Access Point (hardware device) cannot function as a router. Routers
manage local area networks, provide communications with other networks, ensure
security, etc. Access Points typically only provide access to the networks
established by routers.</p>
<p>
In general, routers and routing is a very large and complicated area of knowledge.
But WiFi routers reside on the simpler and cheaper end of the router family. A
WiFi router can be roughly defined as a network device providing two main
services:</p>
<ul>
<li>It connects multiple devices (computers, phones, tablets, printers, etc)
to a Local Area Network (which is often a home network).</li>
<li>It provides Internet access for all those connected devices.</li>
</ul>
<p>
As of the year 2021, a typical WiFi router provides 1000 Mbit/s Ethernet ports
for wired connections and dual-band wireless access, supports 802.11ac (WiFi 5),
provides many other functions like DHCP, Firewall, etc.</p>




<h4>
<a name="antennas">Antennas direction and router location</a></h4>
<p>
WiFi coverage is limited, walls and other obstacles decrease the signal. So, it
is important to find an optimal location for your WiFi router. The universal rule:
it should be equidistant from all the signal sources, whatever it means in your
case. Probably, somewhere in the center of the house or office space.</p>
<p>
Also, you should choose the optimal orientation for your router's antennas.
By default, antennas must be pointing <b>straight to the sky</b>. To be more
exact: position antennas upward for a better horizontal reach; position antennas
sideways for better vertical reach (e.g. in a two-story house).</p>



<h5>About walls and other obstacles</h5>
<p>
The WiFi signal penetrates the obstacles and tries to go around the obstacles.
The more obstacles, the worse for the signal. Obstacles may cause absorbtions
and reflections of the signal, and sometimes the result is unpredictable.</p>
<p>
The open space is the best case.</p>
<p>
Some materials (e.g. wood, plastic, ordinary glass) are quite penetrable for the
wireless signals. Others, like tinted glass, water (large volumes), brick, plaster
are materials with the medium absorbtion. The worst obstacles are concrete (walls,
floors, ceilings), metal (e.g. iron doors, metal nets, grates), ceramics.</p>
<p>
Here is a table showing how much some obstacles decrease the WiFi range (2.4 GHz
band). Note that these <b>numbers are approximate</b>, just for the better
understanding of the problem.</p>

<p>
Some other recommendations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep your router away from the <b>massive metal objects</b> - they effectively
dissipates electromagnetic energy. This also applies to the large volumes of
<b>water</b> (e.g. big aquarium).</li>

<li>The potential <b>sources of interference</b> in the 2.4 GHz band:
<ul class="tight">
<li>Microwave ovens</li>
<li>2.4 GHz cordless phones, DSSS and FHSS</li>
<li>Fluorescent bulbs</li>
<li>2.4 GHz video cameras</li>
<li>Elevator motors</li>
<li>Cauterizing devices</li>
<li>Plasma cutters</li>
<li>Bluetooth radios</li>
<li>Nearby 802.11, 802.11b or 802.11g WLANs</li>
<li>Wireless Internet Service Providers (WISPs)</li>
</ul></li>

<li>The potential <b>sources of interference</b> in the 5 GHz band:
<ul class="tight">
<li>5 GHz cordless phones</li>
<li>Radars</li>
<li>Perimeter sensors</li>
<li>Digital satellites</li>
<li>Nearby 802.11a or 802.11n WLANs</li>
<li>Outdoor wireless 5 GHz bridges</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Some people are afraid of WiFi routers (radiates electromagnetic waves). WiFi
routers don't like people too - humans absorb electromagnetic waves. So, try to
keep the reasonable distance between those entities.</li>

<li>If possible, mount your WiFi router high, i.e. over the obstacles.</li>
</ul>




<h4>
<a name="bands">Bands</a></h4>
<p>
<i><b>WiFi frequency bands: 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz.</b></i></p>
<p>
<b>Frequency bands</b> are ranges of radio wave frequencies used to transmit
data in the wireless spectrum. These bands can further be broken down into WiFi
<a href="#channels">channels</a>. The general rule: higher frequency provides
faster data transmission, but shorter signal range.</p>
<p>
The main differences between 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Network coverage</b>. 2.4 GHz band provides better coverage than 5 GHz.
The lower frequencies can more easily penetrate solid objects, like walls.</li>
<li><b>Network speed</b>. 5 GHz band is faster than 2.4 GHz, it provides up to
1300 Mbps, while 2.4 GHz band support speeds between 450 Mbps and 600 Mbps at
best.</li>
<li><b>Co-channel interference</b>. In the 2.4 GHz band, you can choose from 11
WiFi channels, and only 3 of them are non-overlapping. In the 5 GHz band, you can
choose from 45 channels, where 24 are non-overlapping. Overlapping channels suffer
from interference. Also, 2.4 GHz band is used by some household appliances, and
this can make the situation even worse.</li>
</ul>




<h4>
<a name="channels">Channels</a></h4>
<p>
WiFi channels are smaller bands within WiFi frequency bands that are used
to send and receive data. In general, you can have:</p>
<ul>
<li>11 WiFi channels in the 2.4 GHz frequency band</li>
<li>45 WiFi channels in the 5 GHz frequency band</li>
</ul>
<p>
Some WiFi channels are better than others because of</p>
<ul>
<li><b>co-channel interference</b> - devices are competing for time to talk on
the same channel;</li>
<li><b>adjacent-channel interference</b> - devices from overlapping channels are
trying to talk over each other;</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can avoid such interference by choosing to use a non-overlapping, uncrowded
WiFi channel. Of course, if there is a possibility to choose from something.</p>
<p>
Each WiFi channel has a 20 MHz segment in the frequency band. Several channels
can be bonded together to form wider segments. The width of a WiFi channel
dictates the throughput. Or, simply speaking, the wider channel - the faster
speed, and more data transferred. Unless they are impacted by interference.</p>


<h5>Choosing a WiFi channel width</h5>
<p>
Interference is more common in certain frequency bands on certain channels. There
are some recommended channel width settings for routers and access points:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Set 2.4 GHz WiFi channel width to 20 MHz</b>.
Because there are several overlapping channels in this band - 8 out of 11. This
can cause an interference, and, more likely than not, a weaker wireless performance
instead of the expected faster speeds.</li>
<li>
<b>Set 5 GHz WiFi channel width to 20, 40, or 80 MHz</b>.
This band has significantly more channels, and 24 out of 45 do not overlap.
So, it is less crowded and better equipped to support wide channels.</li>
</ul>
<p>
When adjusting channel width settings for 5 GHz band, you should enable support
for all channel widths. Otherwise devices supporting 20 MHz channels only, won't
be able to connect to a router with 80 MHz-only mode.</p>




<h4>
<a name="ssid">SSID, BSSID, ESSID</a></h4>
<p>
<i><b>SSID</b> - for regular users, <b>BSSID</b> and <b>ESSID</b> - for pros.</i></p>
<p>
The terms BSSID, ESSID, and SSID are used to describe sections of a wireless
network (WLAN). They have slightly different meanings.</p>
<p>
A regular user needs to know <b>SSID</b> to connect to a wireless network. SSIDs
are names of wireless networks.</p>
<p>
Administrators and pros should probably know about <b>BSSID</b>s and
<b>ESSID</b>s.</p>


<h5>SSID</h5>
<p>
<b>Service Set</b> is just another term referencing a wireless network (WLAN).</p>
<p>
<p>
Since WLANs can coexist in the same area/airspace, each WLAN needs a unique name.
This name is <b>SSID</b> (the Service Set ID of the network). SSIDs serve as WiFi
network names and are typically natural language labels. The SSID is broadcast by
stations in beacon packets to announce the presence of a network. A mobile device
looks for all networks in the range when you try to connect to a local WiFi.</p>
<p>
To connect to a specific WLAN, you need to know its SSID and password.</p>


<h5>
<a name="bssid">BSSID</a></h5>
<p>
<b>BSS</b> (Basic Service Set) is the area covered by one Access Point.</p>
<p>
The Access Points within WLAN are identified by <b>BSSID</b> - a Basic Service Set
Identifier. BSSID is included in all wireless packets. By convention a MAC address
of an Access Point is used as BSSID, i.e, if you know the MAC address, you know the
BSSID, and, since all packets contain the originator's BSSID, you can usually trace
those packets. This works fine for an access point with one radio and one WLAN
configured.</p>
<p>
Most often, there are different BSSIDs on an Access Point for each WLAN configured
on a radio. If you have an AP with 2 radios and 32 WLANs configured on each, you
would have 64 BSSIDs plus the base access point BSSID. To accommodate the multiple
BSSIDs, each AP is assigned a unique block of 64 MAC addresses. Each radio has 32
MAC addresses and supports up to 32 service set identifiers (SSIDs), with one MAC
address assigned to each SSID as a basic service set identification (BSSID). All
MAC addresses for an access point are assigned based on the base MAC address of the
AP (usually the Access Point MAC address block is listed on a label on the back of
the AP).</p>



<h5><a name="essid">ESSID</a></h5>
<p>
<b>ESS</b> (Extended Service Set or Extended Basic Service Set) consists of all
BSSs in the network. Technically, <b>ESSID</b> identifies the same network as the SSID does. The term SSID is
used most often.</p>
