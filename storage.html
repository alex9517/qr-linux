<a name="sata">SATA interface</a></h2>
<p>
SATA (Serial ATA) is an interface for connecting HDDs, SSDs, and optical drives
to computers. SATA replaced the old parallel ATA interface (PATA, aka IDE). Max
transfer speed of PATA was <span class="sserif">133 MB/s</span>. Some
abbreviations:</p>
<img class="float_right" src="images/sata_data_cable.jpg" />
<ul>
<li><b>HDD</b> - Hard Disk Drive,</li>
<li><b>SSD</b> - Solid State Drive,</li>
<li><b>IDE</b> - Integrated Drive Electronics,</li>
<li><b>PATA</b> - Parallel Advanced Technology Attachment,</li>
<li><b>SATA</b> - Serial Advanced Technology Attachment,</li>
<li><b>SAS</b> - Serial Attached SCSI,</li>
<li><b>SCSI</b> - Small Computer System Interface; it's older then PATA but
still used by servers (as SAS),</li>
<li><b>NVMe</b> - NVM Express, Non-Volatile Memory Host Controller Interface;</li>
</ul>
<img class="centered" src="images/sata_pinout_data_power.jpg" />
<p>
SATA cables can be as long as <span class="sserif">1m</span>
(<span class="sserif">3.3ft</span>), each SATA drive requires a separate cable,
because it's <b>one drive per channel</b> technology, and they are
<b>hot-pluggable</b>.</p>

<b>NCQ</b> (Native Command Queuing) increases HDD performance by reordering
the commands send by computer. Some SSDs also use NCQ, but in a different
manner: SSD has no need to compensate latency caused by magnetic heads
movement, so reordering has no sense, but queuing can be usefull.</p>
<p>
Currently, SATA has a number of misc connectors and form factors like
<b>Micro SATA</b> (aka uSATA or &#956;SATA) for
<span class="sserif">1.8</span>-inch drives, <b>eSATA</b> for external
connectivity (it uses a more robust connector, shielded cables up to
<span class="sserif">2m</span>, etc), <span class="sserif"><b>M.2</b></span>
for computer expansion cards and associated connectors.</p>
<p>
<b>SAS</b> (Serial Attached SCSI) uses the same physical interconnects as
SATA, and most SAS HBAs (Host Bus Adapter) also support
<span class="sserif">3</span> and <span class="sserif">6 Gbit/s</span> SATA
devices.</p>



<h3>
<a name="ssd">SSD (Solid State Drive)</a></h3>

<h5>SSD form-factors</h5>
<p>
<span class="sserif"><b>SATA, M.2, PCI Express card</b></span></p>
<p>
Strictly speaking, SATA is an interface specification. But when SSDs became
popular, SATA became a SSD's form-factor. So, now any SSD in
<span class="sserif">2.5"</span> case with standard SATA connectors is a
<b>SATA SSD</b>:</p>

<img class="centered" src="images/ssd.jpg" />
<p>
Since SATA (as interface) has speed limits, the next logical step was to
connect SSDs directly to the PCI bus. As a result we got NVMe, Non-Volatile
Memory Express and two additional form factors: NVMe on a standard PCI
Express card (like graphics card) and NVMe on a small card
(<span class="sserif">22x100mm</span>, <span class="sserif">22x80mm</span>,
<span class="sserif">22x60mm</span>, ...) inserted into a new
<span class="sserif"><b>M.2</b></span> slot on computer's motherboard.</p>

<img class="centered" src="images/ssd_sata_3_m2.jpg" />
<p>
It's obvious that SATA and PCIe form-factors are too big for SSD, and PCIe
slots on the motherboard are "precious", especially for extreme gamers using
two graphics cards. So, <span class="sserif"><b>NVMe M.2</b></span> is probably
the winner in the near future.</p>
<p>
Note that <span class="sserif"><b>M.2</b></span> (in the past it was called
<b>NGFF</b>, new generation form-factor) can support several interfaces,
including SATA (same speed limit as for SATA SSD), PCIe (faster then SATA and
does not occupy PCIe slot), NVMe (probably the best of all).</p>
<p>
The most popular SSDs in 2020 seems to be <span class="sserif"><b>NVMe SSD Type
2280</b></span> (<span class="sserif">80mm</span>) cards connected to
<span class="sserif"><b>M.2</b></span> socket on the motherboard. Of course,
you can only use these SSDs if your motherboard has
<span class="sserif"><b>M.2</b></span> socket. Otherwise you need SATA SSD.</p>


<h5>SSD speeds</h5>
<p>
Non-Volatile Memory Express is an open standard developed to allow modern SSDs
to operate at the read/write speeds their flash memory is capable of. So, let's
compare.</p>
<p>
An average read/write speed of a typical <span class="sserif">7200rpm</span>
SATA HDD is <span class="sserif"><b>~100 MB/s</b></span> (megabytes per sec).
SATA SSDs provide <span class="sserif"><b>~530/500 MB/s</b></span>. Read is
faster than write, and the difference can be essential. NVMe SSDs are absolute
 champions with read/write speeds up to <span class="sserif"><b>3500/3200
MB/s</b></span>. That is, roughly <span class="sserif"><b>6x</b></span> faster
than SATA SSDs and <span class="sserif"><b>30x</b></span> faster than HDDs.</p>
<p>
Of course, the above numbers are just some average estimates. In fact, some
users complain that they have not noticed big difference after replacing SATA
SSD with NVMe. On the other hand, the difference between SSD and HDD is very
noticeable.</p> 


<h5>Ajusting your system to Solid State Drive</a></h5>
<p>
Typical SSD root filesystem in <samp>/etc/fstab</samp>:</p>

<p class="fmt"><samp>UUID=f0a...5d  /  ext4 noatime,errors=remount-ro  0 1</samp></p>
<p>
However, this should not be used for <b>swap</b> and <b>efi</b> partitions,
if they exist.</p>

<p class="warn">Note!</p>
<p class="indent">When I installed Ubuntu 18.04 on <span class="sserif">256
Gb</span> SSD, the default installation procedure created
<span class="sserif">512 Mb</span> <b>efi</b> partition and the rest went
to <b>ext4</b> partition (root, home, and everything). And no swap partition
- a swap file instead.</p>
<p class="indent">When I installed Ubuntu 19.04 on <span class="sserif">128
Gb</span> SSD, the default installation procedure created only one <b>ext4</b>,
i.e., all-in-one, no efi, no swap, just <samp>/boot</samp> dir and
<samp>/swapfile</samp> (<span class="sserif">~2GB</span>) .</p>


<h5>About tmpfs</h5>
<p>
I prefer to use <samp>tmpfs</samp> (i.e., RAM) for temp files, logs and
spools:</p>
<div class="file">
<pre>
none   /tmp  tmpfs defaults,noatime,mode=1777,size=10%  0 0
tmpfs  /var/spool  tmpfs defaults,noatime,mode=1777  0 0
tmpfs  /var/log    tmpfs defaults,noatime,mode=1777  0 0</pre>
</div>
<p>
Note that <samp>/var/tmp</samp> dir is used to keep some stuff
between reboots, and it should not be configured as <samp>tmpfs</samp>!</p>


<h5>Examples of /etc/fstab</h5>
<p>
In both cases root filesystem on SSD:</p>
<ul>
<li><samp><a href="files/etc_fstab.txt">/etc/fstab</a></samp> without
<b>efi</b> and <b>swap</b> partitions, no separate <samp>home</samp> partition;</li>
<li><samp><a href="files/etc_fstab_old.txt">/etc/fstab</a></samp>
with <b>efi</b> and <b>swap</b> partitions, <samp>home</samp> filesystem is
a separate partition on SSD;</li>
</ul>


<h5>Trimming</h5>
<p>
In Linux systems with <samp>systemd</samp>, scheduled tasks are usually
executed by <a href="boot.html#timers">systemd timers</a>, and probably you
don't need to bother about trimming. Just make sure that timer and service
are O.K.:</p>

<p class="cmd">systemctl status fstrim.timer</p>
<p>
Probably you should also check it the next day after scheduled execution because
<i>systemd</i> logs are volatile (<samp>/run/log/journal/*</samp>) and disappear
after reboot. Note that for <i>systemd</i><samp> weekly </samp>usually means
"on Monday, early, like at <samp>00:00</samp> or within an hour after midnight".</p>
<!--
<div class="box1" style="padding-bottom:0.1em">
<p>
In some older systems you have to remove trimming from <samp>cron</samp>
(check <samp>cron.weekly</samp>) and set trimming at system boot. Edit
<samp>/etc/rc.local</samp> according to your partitioning schema:</p>
<div class="file">
<pre>
fstrim -v /
fstrim -v /home
exit 0</pre>
</div></div>
-->


<h5>Optimize swapping</h5>
<p>
Check <samp>/etc/sysctl.conf</samp>, there must be:</p>
<div class="file">
<pre>
# Sharply reduce swap inclination
vm.swappiness=1
# Improve cache management
vm.vfs_cache_pressure=50</pre>
</div>


<h5>Limit the write actions of Mozilla Firefox web-browser</h5>
<p>
Basically, there are two parameters you should take care of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Session store interval (don't save session info too often).</li>
<li>Browser cache (how large and where to keep).</li>
</ul>
<p>
Start manual config (type <samp>about:config</samp> in URL bar).</p>
<p>
Find <samp>browser.sessionstore.interval</samp>. By default it's usually
<samp>15000</samp> (<samp>15</samp> sec). Change it to a larger value, e.g.,
<samp>100,000,000</samp> (~<samp>28</samp> hours), or, at least,
<samp>3,600,000</samp> (~<samp>1</samp> hour).</p>
<div class="file">
<pre>
  browser.sessionstore.interval    100000000</pre>
</div>
<p>
Find and set following parameters:</p>
<div class="file">
<pre>
  browser.cache.disk.enable        false
  ...
  browser.cache.memory.enable      true
  browser.cache.memory.capacity    204800
</pre></div>
<p>
The last param is usually missing from the default browser config, because
browser prefers to keep its cache on disk (HDD). If you found that key,
just set the value, otherwise you have to create a new entry like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right-click somewhere in the blank area within the Firefox config window,
and select: <b>New &gt; Integer</b>.</li>
<li>
Create a new key (preference name) <samp>browser.cache.memory.capacity</samp>
(you will see the dialog "Enter the preference name").</li>
<li>Now set the value (integer value in KB), something in the range
<samp>51200..204800</samp> (i.e., from <span class="sserif">50Mb</span> to
<span class="sserif">200Mb</span>) depending on your RAM size. Of course, you
can make it smaller or larger, the values above are just a recommendation. But
remember that <samp>0</samp> means "no cache", while <samp>-1</samp> means
"unlimited cache" (probably not the best option).</li>
<li>Restart Mozilla Firefox.</li>
<li>Type in the URL bar <samp>about:cache</samp> to see if your changes were
activated.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Note! These are <b>user preferences</b>, i.e., they are not global throughout
the system, but only effective for a particular user account.</p>


<!--
<p>
You can disable anti-phishing features (system will be less secure).</p>
<p>
Either use
<b>Edit</b> / <b>Preferences</b> / <b>Security</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Block reported attack sites</li>
<li>Block reported web forgeries</li>
</ul>
<p>
or use <samp>about:config</samp> page and set to <samp>false</samp>:</p>
<ul>
<li><samp>browser.safebrowsing.enabled</samp></li>
<li><samp>browser.safebrowsing.malware.enabled</samp></li>
</ul>
<p>
Now you must close Firefox and delete all files beginning with
<samp>urlclassifier</samp> in your profile folder
<samp>~/.mozilla/firefox/<kbd>xxxxxxxx</kbd>.default</samp>:</p>

<p class="cmd">rm -i ~/.mozilla/firefox/*.default/urlclassifier*</p>
<p>
Some of those files will be recreated by FF, but they won't grow any
larger than their initial size.</p>
-->


<h5>Limit the write actions of the Java plugin</h5>
<p>
If you have installed Oracle Java:</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch the Java Control Panel -&gt; Tab General:</li>
<ul>
<li>Temporary Internet Files -&gt; Settings...</li>
<ul>
<li>Remove the tick for: Keep temporary files on my computer.</li>
</ul></ul></ul>



<h2>
<a name="usb">USB interface</a></h2>
<p>
<b>Universal Serial Bus</b> was designed to standardize, improve,
simplify the interface between personal computers and peripherals like
pointing devices, keyboards, digital cams, printers, portable disk drives,
etc.</p>
<p>
Besides the data exchange, USB port also provides electric power to
a connected device. USB 1.x &amp; 2.0 supplied <span class="sserif"><b>5V</b></span>
only, USB 3.x can additionally supply <span class="sserif"><b>20V</b></span>.</p>

<img class="centered" src="images/usb_pins1.png" />

<table style="font-family:Droid-Sans;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto">
<tr>
<td>Pin 1</td><td style="background:red;width:2em">&nbsp;</td><td>VBUS (+5 V)</td></tr>
<td>Pin 2</td><td style="background:grey;width:2em">&nbsp;</td><td>Data−</td></tr>

<p>
Keep in mind that:</p>
<ul>
<li>USB has a strict <b>tree topology</b> and <b>master-slave protocol</b>.
It means that peripheral devices cannot interact one with another directly
(only via the host), two hosts also cannot communicate directly over USB ports.</li>
<li>USB <b>does not support broadcasting</b>, each peripheral device must be
addressed individually.</li>
<li>USB is <b>hot pluggable</b>, i.e., you can connect/disconnect a peripheral
device whenever you need, and you don't have to power down (or restart)
computer.</li>
<li>USB interface is <b>self-configuring</b>, there is no need to adjust
settings on the device and interface for speed, data format, interrupts, I/O
addresses, DMA channels, etc.</li>
<li>Cable length is limited (<span class="sserif">5m</span> for USB 2.0),
shorter cables are usually better.</li>
<li>Cables of the same type are not always identical, some "differences"
in pins and wires are possible.</li>
<li>Power supplied by a USB port can be not sufficient for a specific
peripheral device (table below shows max values, not every USB port provides
those numbers).</li>
</ul>
<img class="centered" src="images/usb_connectors.jpg" />
<p>
Note that <b>Type-C</b> has a symmetric shape and works either way up, i.e., you [normal people] cannot insert it incorrectly!</p>
<p>
There are three generations of USB spec:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>USB 1.x</b> (now totally outdated) was released in 1996 (USB 1.0), 1998 (USB 1.1),</li>
<li><b>USB 2.0</b> was released in 2000/2001,</li>
<li><b>USB 3.x</b> was released in 2008 (USB 3.1 in 2013, USB 3.2 in 2017)</li>

<h5>USB power standards</h5>
<p>
In general USB supplies <span class="sserif"><b>5V &#177; 5%</b></span>.
However, when it comes to power consumption, USB spec uses such term as a
<b>unit load</b>:</p>
<div class="term"><pre>
1 unit load is 100 mA for USB 1.x &amp; 2.0
1 unit load is 150 mA for USB 3.0 SuperSpeed dev
1 unit load is 250 mA for USB 3.2 Gen x2 Multi-lane
  SuperSpeed devices</pre></div>
<p>
The <b>low-power devices</b> are those with power consumption up to 1 unit
load, i.e., below <span class="sserif">100 mA</span> (e.g., keyboard, mouse).</p>
<p>
The <b>high-power devices</b>  (e.g., external HDD) are those with power
consumption between <span class="sserif">1 unit</span> load and
<span class="sserif">5 unit</span> loads, i.e., up to <span class="sserif">500
mA</span>. For USB 3.0 the upper limit is <span class="sserif">6 unit</span> loads
(<span class="sserif">900 mA</span>). For USB 3.2 Gen x2 upper limit is
<span class="sserif">6 unit</span> loads (<span class="sserif">1.5 A</span>).</p>
<p>
Higher currents (<span class="sserif">1.5..3 A</span>) and higher voltages
(<span class="sserif">20V</span> at <span class="sserif">3..5 A</span>) are
related to <b>Battery Charging</b> (BC) and <b>Power Delivery</b> (PD) specs. See
<a href="https://manhattanproducts.eu/pages/usb-c-pd-charging-everything-you-need-to-know" target="_top">Power Delivery</a>
or <a href="https://www.usb.org/usb-charger-pd" target="_top">USB Power Delivery</a>.</p>



<h5>USB device class</h5>
<p>
The functionality of a USB device is defined by a class code sent by device

with the <samp>FAT32</samp>, or <samp>exFAT</samp> file systems. However, to
the system, a flash drive looks like a USB-connected hard drive, and it can be
reformatted to any file system supported by the host OS.</p>

<h5>Longevity</h5>
<p>
The majority of flash drives use a <i>multi-level cell</i> (MLC) based memory
which is good for around <span class="sserif"><b>3,000-5,000</b></span>
program-erase cycles, but some flash drives have <i>single-level cell</i> (SLC)
based memory that is good for around <span class="sserif"><b>100,000</b></span>
writes. And there is practically no limit to the number of reads from the flash
memory. Remember, however, that a typical USB connector warrants only around
<span class="sserif"><b>1,500</b></span> insert-removal cycles.</p>


<h5>Speed</h5>
<p>
The data transfer speed is limited by the slowest of three factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>USB version used,</li>
<li>the quality of the USB controller device that reads and writes data onto
the flash memory,</li>
<li>the speed of the hardware bus, especially in the case of add-on USB ports.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The last param is the host param, USB flash drive has nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>
Many manufacturers avoid to declare the speeds of their USB flash drives
because it's a complex parameter - not just a couple of values (read/write),
but the large set of numbers depending on unknown (beforehand) conditions like
port's USB version, the quality of host controller, the quality of software
drivers, the mode of operation, the sizes of files, etc. So, if the speed is
declared, it's usually some average number for some optimal/ideal conditions.
The real speeds are slower. The only things you can trust (more or less):
the reading is almost alway faster than writing; the large number of small
files usually goes slower than the small number of big files; the more
expensive flash drives are faster in general, but not always. Here you
can see examples from some price list (speeds are in Megabytes/sec):</p>

<h5>
<a name="usb_flash_fs">File system</a></h5>
<p>
The most popular file systems for USB flash drives are <b>FAT32</b> and
<b>exFAT</b> (both are supported by the majority of operating systems). The
exFAT (Extended File Allocation Table, was introduced by Microsoft in 2006) is
optimized for flash memory such as USB flash drives and SD cards, and it can
store really big files, up to <span class="sserif"><b>128 PB</b></span>
(petabytes) - an essential advantage over FAT32 which does not accept files
larger than <span class="sserif">4GB</span>.</p>
<p>
However, it looks like the majority of USB flash drives still (2019) arrive
to users formatted with FAT32, and it's OK until you need to store files bigger
than <span class="sserif"><b>4GB</b></span>. So, before you start using your
new USB flash, think if, maybe, you should format it with exFAT.</p>
<p>
Note that Linux users and developers persistently designate FAT32
as <samp>vfat</samp> though it's not quite correct. Be aware that
<samp>vfat</samp> can be FAT32, but it can aslo be FAT16, or even FAT12
(see <a href="cmds_m.html#mkfs">mkfs</a>).</p>
<p>
In Linux, to format USB flash drive with exFAT, first make sure the
appropriate software is installed, not all Linux systems support exFAT out
of the box. In case of Ubuntu:</p>

<p class="cmd">sudo apt-get install exfat-utils exfat-fuse</p>
<p>
As usually, before formatting, <b>don't forget to save what you need to
save!</b> When your USB flash drive is inserted and mounted, find its device
name. There are many ways to do it, e.g.:</p>

<p class="cmd">df</p>
<p>
Let's assume the name is <samp>/dev/sdf1</samp>. Now you can format this flash
drive with the following cmd, but, again, before you start, <i>make sure (1)
the device name is correct, and (2) all precious data from this drive was
saved!</i>:</p>

<p class="cmd">mkfs.exfat -n FLASH01 /dev/sdf1</p>


<h5>Usage notes</h5>
<p>
Disconnecting USB flash without unmounting filesystem won't damage device
itself (it's hot-pluggable), but it can damage the filesystem.</p>
<p>
Also, you should be cautious with static electricity, especially during cold
winters when the humidity is low. The probability of damage is low, but, if
you care, "discharge" yourself before touching/connecting anything.</p>
<p>
Dropping USB flash in the water is not lethal (in most cases) unless you
insert it into a working USB port before the liquid evaporates from the
internal parts.</p>



<h4>
<a name="usb_init">Reinitialization of the bootable USB flash drive</a></h4>
<p>
(assuming the device is <samp>/dev/sdf</samp>)</p>
<p>
If your "bootable" USB stick does not boot, you can try the following
procedure (in general it is safe, but as with all such ops there is always
a risk of data loss).</p>
<p>
Run <code>cfdisk</code> and find the partition ID. It must be
<samp>LBA FAT32</samp> (<samp>0B</samp> or <samp>0C</samp>):</p>

<p class="cmd">cfdisk /dev/sdf</p>
<!--
<p>
Format the partition:</p>

<p class="cmd">mkfs.vfat -F 32 -n SYSRESC /dev/sdf1</p>
-->
<p>
Overwrite the first <samp>440</samp> bytes of the MBR. It's supposed to erase
the prev boot instructions with the default ones to make the stick bootable.
If you do everything right, the partition table is not changed (it starts at
offset <samp>446</samp>):</p>

<p class="cmd">dd if=/usr/share/syslinux/mbr.bin of=/dev/sdf</p>
<p>
A similar cmd in Ubuntu:</p>

<p class="cmd">dd if=/usr/lib/syslinux/mbr.bin of=/dev/sdf</p>
<p>
The same cmd, but more safe:</p>

<p class="cmd">dd bs=440 count=1 if=/usr/lib/syslinux/mbr.bin of=/dev/sdf</p>
<p>
Make sure that all changes have been flushed to the disk.</p>

<p class="cmd">sync</p>



<h4>
<a name="reset_usb">Restoring USB flash drive to its original state</a></h4>
<p>
(original state: empty VFAT, non-bootable)<br>
(assuming the device is <samp>/dev/sdf</samp>)</p>
</p>
<p>
Let's suppose you created a bootable USB flash with a hybrid Ubuntu Linux
image. Then later you decided to remove Linux image and use it as a regular
USB flash. But when you try to delete files, system says "it's read only".
And besides, it's bootable and probably has GPT. So, you must take care of
all this stuff.</p>
<ul>
<li>Delete existing partitions (using
<a href="cmds_f.html#fdisk"><code>fdisk</code></a> or
<a href="cmds_g.html#gdisk"><code>gdisk</code></a> or other similar tools
you rely on.</li>
<li>If the above apps report the presence of GPT, remove it too. Probably
you'll have to use <code>gdisk</code>'s advanced options, unless you have
something more convenient.</li>
<li>Create a new empty partition (probably using all available space).</li>
<li>Create a filesystem (VFAT):</li>
</ul>
<p class="cmd">mkfs.vfat -F 32 -n VIDEO_01 /dev/sdf1</p>

<p class="center" id="show_nas">
<span class="ref">Do not confuse SAN with NAS!</span></p>

<div class="box1" id="nas" style="display:none">
<p>
<b>NAS</b> (network-attached storage) is a simple and relatively unexpensive
<b>file-server</b> that is mostly used as a home appliance to store all kinds
of large files like movies, music, etc. Of course, there are corporate models
like 2U rack-mounted devices. But typical NAS looks like a compact box with two
or four SATA HDDs configured as <span class="sserif">RAID 1</span> or
<span class="sserif">RAID 10</span> managed by simple software RAID (aka
FakeRAID) controller, because hardware RAID controller would be too expensive
for such system.</p>
</div>
<p>
<b>Storage Area Network</b> is a special kind of network (network behind the
servers) used by <i>storage devices</i> and <i>servers</i>. Note that servers
(database servers, application servers, web servers, etc) are considered
clients in this network.</p>
<p>
Unlike the traditional <i>shared network storage</i> technologies that work
with files (NFS, file-servers), SAN operates with <i>data blocks</i> (aka
<i>chunks</i>). In other words, to server's operating system SAN looks like
a locally-attached RAID box.</p>

<h5>Fibre Channel</h5>
<p>
Fibre Channel is a high-speed data transfer network (usually running at
<span class="sserif">2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 gigabits per second</span>)
providing in-order, lossless delivery of raw block data.</p>
<p>
Fibre Channel network is built up of Fibre Channel adapters and switches
connected with fiber optic cables.</p>

<img class="centered" src="images/qlogic_fc_adapter.jpg" />
<p>
<b>Fibre Channel Protocol</b> (FCP) is the SCSI interface protocol utilising an
underlying Fibre Channel connection. FCP consists of the following layers:</p>
<ul>
<li><samp><b>FC-0</b></samp> provides the physical media interface;</li>
<li><samp><b>FC-1</b></samp> performs data encoding/decoding and out-of-band
physical link control info for transmission over the physical media;</li>
<li><samp><b>FC-2</b></samp> transfers frames, sequences and exchanges
comprising protocol info units;</li>
<li><samp><b>FC-3</b></samp> provides common services required for advanced
features such as striping, hunt group and multicast;</li>
<li><samp><b>FC-4</b></samp> provides application interfaces that can execute
over Fibre Channel, e.g. FCS (Fibre Channel Protocol for SCSI), FC-LE (Fibre
Channel Link Encapsulation);</li>
</ul>
<img class="centered" src="images/fcp.jpg" />
<p>
Unlike TCP/IP which is supposed to handle unpredictable channel quality, data
loss, intricate topology, etc, FCP is a relatively simple protocol optimized
for fast and reliable data transfer in reliable networks with simple topology.
Typical Fibre Channel speeds are <span class="sserif">8 Gbps</span>,
<span class="sserif">16 Gbps</span>, and <span class="sserif">32 Gbps</span>.
FC SAN is isolated from LAN, i.e., users and client devices are not directly
connected to SAN.</p>


<h5>iSCSI</h5>
<p>
was invented to send SCSI commands using TCP/IP and related equipment.</p>
<p>
You can organize iSCSI SAN within your LAN using standard Ethernet cards,
cables, switches, but the throughput will be very far from FC SAN. Obviously,
<span class="sserif">1 Gbit/s</span> Ethernet adapter on a desktop's
motherboard is not that kind of device you can use to build something close
to FC SAN.</p>
<p>
But you can build a dedicated <span class="sserif">10 Gbit/s</span>
Ethernet-based network (either optical or copper) for servers and storage
devices. Of course, in this case you must buy hardware-accelerated adapters,
the appropriate network switches supporting large data frames, etc. It will be
faster than SAN within LAN, but TCP/IP overhead still stays, and costs become
comparable to FC. And configuration process won't be trivial. You must install
and configure iSCSI Target/Initiator software onto your storage server and its
clients, configure IP addresses of iSCSI storage and clients, optimize
hardware/network settings like Flow Control,
<a href="tcpip.html#jumbo_frame">Jumbo Frames</a>, Spanning Tree, Trunks,
etc.</p>


<h5>FCoE (Fibre Channel over Ethernet)</h5>
<p>
<b>Fibre Channel over Ethernet</b> is a computer network technology that
encapsulates FC frames over Ethernet networks. This allows Fibre Channel to use
<span class="sserif">10 Gigabit</span> (or higher) Ethernet networks while
preserving the FCP (Fibre Channel Protocol).</p>
<p>
This technology combines benefits of both FC and Ethernet. With FCoE,
FC becomes another network protocol running on Ethernet alongside traditional
IP traffic (see <a href="tcpip.html#ethernet_frame">Ethernet Frame</a>). FCoE
operates <i>directly above Ethernet</i> in the network protocol stack, in
contrast to iSCSI which runs on top of TCP/IP. It also means that FCoE is not
routable at the IP layer and will not work across the routed IP networks.</p>
<p>
The main benefit of FCoE is its ability to use <i>converged</i> infrastructure,
which allows LAN and SAN traffic to pass through using the same hardware and
links, while still maintaining isolation. The best examples are <i>Blade
servers</i>. Using copper Ethernet lines and switches with the support of FCoE,
it allows system administrators to change LAN/SAN distribution depending on
the business needs.</p>
<p>
If you are already using high-performance networks
(<span class="sserif">10 Gbit/s</span> or better) with FCoE-enabled switches
and adapters, this technology is a good alternative to the classic Fibre
Channel.</p>
